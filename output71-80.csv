His latest EP embraces restraint and subtlety\xe2\x80\x94a pure, 18-minute jolt\xc2\xa0of traditionalist R&B.'","b'Since the early 2000s, the proprietors of the TDE label\xe2\x80\x94Anthony \xe2\x80\x9cTop Dawg\xe2\x80\x9d Tiffith, Dave \xe2\x80\x9cMiyatola\xe2\x80\x9d Free, and Terrence \xe2\x80\x9cPunch\xe2\x80\x9d Henderson\xe2\x80\x94have made\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0home for\xc2\xa0more critical darlings per capita than perhaps any other hip-hop-dominated outpost. Each of the last three acts signed to TDE (SZA, Lance Skiiiwalker, SiR) have been R&B artists, an indication that the moment\xe2\x80\x99s hottest rap label is perhaps looking to expand its palate.' b'The latest signee is Sir Darryl Farris, aka SiR, an Inglewood-born-and-bred crooner who has spent years following in the footsteps of his older brothers, the songwriters Daniel and Davion Farris (aka WoodWorks), writing for\xc2\xa0artists behind the scenes.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s uncanny for a mainstream R&B newcomer to have started out penning tracks for Jill Scott, Robert Glasper, Stevie Wonder, and Anita Hill\xc2\xa0rather than Drake or Rihanna, but this is central to SiR\xe2\x80\x99s ethos.' b'Her Too is an 18-minute jolt\xc2\xa0of pure, traditionalist R&B and neo-soul. SiR\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0successes lay in his polish and maturity. In this lane, his\xc2\xa0peers have recently focused\xc2\xa0on self-discovery, nostalgia ultra, and experiments in\xc2\xa0form, but\xc2\xa0SiR\xe2\x80\x99s concerns are\xc2\xa0in subtlety, restraint, and finesse.\xc2\xa0SiR\xe2\x80\x99s releases, then\xe2\x80\x942016\xe2\x80\x99s HER EP and 2015\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Seven Sundays among them\xe2\x80\x94have lacked a masterpiece like his labelmate\xc2\xa0Kendrick Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Art of Peer Pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d But\xc2\xa0Her Too contains fantastic analogues to Jay Rock\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHood Gone Love It,\xe2\x80\x9d which are a purist\xe2\x80\x99s thrill.' b'Much of Her Too feels warm and leisurely. SiR has said he was aiming for something darker than his previous EP, but the project doesn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to that\xc2\xa0description, save for a few bars on the Anderson .Paak- and King Mez-assisted opener \xe2\x80\x9cNew LA.\xe2\x80\x9d King Mez raps, \xe2\x80\x9cMan why we take the murder route?/Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be worried about niggas dying, niggas dying?/Or we could just not say shit and take the Cam Newton scary route.\xe2\x80\x9d As virtually the only patch of lyrics that aren\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly romantic, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit\xc2\xa0discordant. On it\xe2\x80\x99s face, it\xe2\x80\x99s a whimsical and somewhat\xc2\xa0funny, topical sports reference. But it plays into the pathology that, no matter a black person\xe2\x80\x99s station in life\xe2\x80\x94and even if they\xe2\x80\x99re currently blinded by love and passion\xe2\x80\x94the threat of state-sanctioned violence lingers in the back of the mind, ready to punch itself into the foreground at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cNew LA\xe2\x80\x9d is nonetheless the project\xe2\x80\x99s brightest and most buoyant moment. Cardiak samples Drake\xe2\x80\x99s overlooked \xe2\x80\x9cWith You,\xe2\x80\x9d crafting a saccharine trance of a beat. \xe2\x80\x9cOoh Nah Nah\xe2\x80\x9d is a smooth, sultry number featuring Masego\xe2\x80\x99s vocals and darting saxophone; it finds SiR bellowing in a tenor full of lust. Five of the six songs here\xc2\xa0embrace a degree of calm, but the closer \xe2\x80\x9cW$ Boi\xe2\x80\x9d possesses kinetic energy that explodes in\xc2\xa0the chorus, as SiR shouts that he\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cwestside boy.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s like SiR\xe2\x80\x99s version of \xe2\x80\x9cUptown Girl,\xe2\x80\x9d which is Billy Joel\xe2\x80\x99s Romeo and Juliet\xe2\x80\x94the template for an endless trove of tales about star-crossed lovers.' b""In his real life, Sir Darryl Farris is about\xc2\xa030, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been with his wife for the better part of a decade. About seven years ago, he was in Hollywood jobless, drug-addicted, and nearly homeless. The W$ Boi returned home and started writing songs in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, which eventually turned his life around. SiR proclaims, \xe2\x80\x9cI don't know if she knows/She don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I been through.\xe2\x80\x9d Even amid a song that could afford to be a bit\xc2\xa0more chaotic, the result is a contained personal anthem. SiR\xe2\x80\x99s debut album is slated to come out whenever Top Dawg chooses, but up to this point,\xc2\xa0his story is one of triumph."""
b'Bing & Ruth',8.2,b'No Home of the Mind',0,b'Experimental',b'February 21 2017',"b'On his third proper\xc2\xa0Bing & Ruth album, and first for 4AD,\xc2\xa0David Moore\xe2\x80\x99s electroacoustic minimalism carries its strongest emotional tug. It\xe2\x80\x99s his earthiest and most distinctive record yet.'","b'Bing & Ruth\xe2\x80\x99s music exists in the cracks between. Project leader David Moore has a degree in music and his earlier compositions, found on the 2010 album City Lake, can have the air of the conservatory. So it makes some sense to slot his work in with\xc2\xa0contemporary classical. But the era of classical music Moore\xc2\xa0most frequently evokes\xe2\x80\x94the trance-inducing minimalism of the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s\xe2\x80\x94has at times been filed as new age. And divisions between *that *genre and the more critically acceptable sphere of \xe2\x80\x9cambient,\xe2\x80\x9d a word that sometimes describes Bing & Ruth, have always been porous. Beyond these labels, Bing & Ruth is also hard to pin functionally. Moore\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0pieces can feel formal, less like \xe2\x80\x9cenvironments\xe2\x80\x9d and more like compositions that need to be tracked carefully over their duration to be understood. Though he\xe2\x80\x99s made music for an ensemble that includes woodwinds and strings, Moore\xc2\xa0also includes processed tapes and production choices that smudge the lines between acoustic and electronic music.' b'On City Lake and 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Tomorrow Was the Golden Age, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s music evoked the best of what had come before him\xe2\x80\x94Philip Glass\xe2\x80\x99 repetition, the emotional shading of Max Richter, Eluvium\xe2\x80\x99s comfort with rock dynamics\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s steadily grown into a sound that feels all his own. No Home of the Mind, his third proper album and first for 4AD, is his most distinctive record yet. His working group is still here, but the arrangements on *No Home *feature Moore\xe2\x80\x99s piano much more prominently, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a more focused record. If City Lake and Tomorrow sometimes found him moving between established styles, demonstrating wide-ranging mastery because he can, the new album stays focused on wringing as much feeling as possible out of narrower terrain. And No Home of the Mind is the earthiest Bing & Ruth record yet.\xc2\xa0You can smell the sweat that went into it.' b'One of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s composition signatures is to turn the piano into a drone instrument. Using rapid clusters of repeating notes, Moore creates piano figures that hang in space like clouds of slowly shifting sound, not unlike passages of La Monte Young\xe2\x80\x99s The Well-Tuned Piano or the work of Young acolytes like Michael Harrison. Where the latter two artists are known for using the piano as a tool for overtones via specialized tuning, Moore creates piano-based drones that serve as the basis for his ensemble pieces. The other instruments\xe2\x80\x99 parts exist in relationship to what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing at the keyboard, offering contrasting textures and leading through varying shifts in mood and tone. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if all the separate parts come together into a single instrument, one that is \xe2\x80\x9cplayed\xe2\x80\x9d collectively by the Bing & Ruth ensemble.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cStarwood Choker\xe2\x80\x9d starts the album sounding like a continuation of the last Bing & Ruth record\xe2\x80\x99s criss-crossing tapestries of sound. But the record really begins\xc2\xa0to reveal itself on \xe2\x80\x9cAs Much as Possible,\xe2\x80\x9d which finds Moore in the realm of \xe2\x80\x9csolo piano with ambient treatments\xe2\x80\x9d \xc3\xa0 la Brian Eno and Harold Budd\xe2\x80\x99s *The Pearl. *Moore\xe2\x80\x99s chord voicings suggest both gospel music and the spare \xe2\x80\x9cfurniture music\xe2\x80\x9d of Satie. As he moves between modes, extremely subtle bits of tension are introduced, built, and then released, while yawning chasms of drone from the ensemble drift in and out beneath. \xe2\x80\x9cAs Much as Possible\xe2\x80\x9d is Moore\xe2\x80\x99s most tender and affecting piece yet, a filmic work that evokes haunting images on its own.' b'Throughout the rest of No Home, the piano moves between heavy drone (\xe2\x80\x9cForm Takes\xe2\x80\x9d), achingly spare and meditative ballads (\xe2\x80\x9cTo All It\xe2\x80\x9d), and pieces that explore how much can be done with simple repetition (\xe2\x80\x9cThe How of It Sped\xe2\x80\x9d). The tracks flow one into the next, which accentuates the connections between them and makes *No Home *feel like a single massive piece, carefully mapping every inch of its defined terrain. Moore is so gifted at teasing out emotion, it seems inevitable that there will be many film and television scores\xc2\xa0in his future, if he chooses to go that route. If that happens, *No Home of the Mind *will be remembered as his breakthrough, the place where all the pieces from earlier records snapped into place.'"
b'Moon Duo',7.1,b'Occult Architecture Vol. 1',0,b'Rock',b'February 21 2017',"b'The latest LP from Moon Duo builds on\xc2\xa0their\xc2\xa0psychedelic formula\xe2\x80\x94corroded guitars, kraut rhythms, steely grit\xe2\x80\x94and\xc2\xa0allows them to\xc2\xa0indulge their most sinister tendencies.'","b'Four albums deep, Moon Duo have grown somewhat predictable. The collaboration of Wooden Shijps\xe2\x80\x99 guitar-warlock Ripley Johnson and keyboardist Sanae Yamada has always been built on a steady but enjoyable mix of elements: corroded guitars, loopy keyboard lines, krautrock rhythms, and psychedelic strains conjuring\xc2\xa0both the whirling cosmos and droning abyss. Their new album Occult Architecture Vol. 1 does little to alter the formula, but the key to Moon Duo records has always been the strength of the compositions. And those\xc2\xa0already onboard with the band won\xe2\x80\x99t be disappointed by the seven tracks here.' b'Touted as representing the depths and changes of the seasons, Occult Architecture Vol. 1\xc2\xa0delves into the bleaker corners of winter and allows Moon Duo to indulge their most sinister tendencies. Like many a great Moon Duo song, opener \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death Set\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0is at once swaggering, sexy, and foreboding. Much of their\xc2\xa0music is low-key cinematic; it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to hear \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death Set\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0distorted, slow-motion whoosh or its bone-rattling beat and not imagine a character\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic entrance into an unnerving nightclub. Elsewhere, like on \xe2\x80\x9cCold Fear\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWill of the Devil,\xe2\x80\x9d they use queasy electronic textures to flirt with gothier territory.' b'Well past the lower-fi nature of their earliest work, Moon Duo still don\xe2\x80\x99t operate with a ton\xc2\xa0of dynamic range. But they use those heart-palpitating rhythms and lacerating keyboard lines to build blown-out, end-times\xc2\xa0epics littered with subtle twists. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s death-drive guitars propel \xe2\x80\x9cCult of Moloch\xe2\x80\x9d forward unwaveringly, but interjections of synth and a second, spiraling guitar part make the song feel like\xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99s reaching for spiritual corners of nature. Closer \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Rose\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one long synth ride\xe2\x80\x94has a similar effect, winding down a\xc2\xa0road into the distance. Moon Duo haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone full-on mystic, however; the new album maintains the steely grit of its predecessor, Shadow of the Sun**.\xc2\xa0Theirs is music still meant for barreling down desert highways in a stolen car, or for the grind and smog of a third-tier industrial city.' b""That said, Moon Duo isn\xe2\x80\x99t the kind of group to make albums with literal thematic angles. Their style has limits, but discernibility is maybe not the point. Moon Duo\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0precise mix of traditions and sounds conjures a\xc2\xa0nihilistic cool, an image of leather-jacketed outlaws chain-smoking in dark alleyways in seedy cities. Occult Architecture Vol. 1 is a good record that\xe2\x80\x99s at its best when Moon Duo fully give in to these seductive inklings, like on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death Set\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCreepin.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sure, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the riff from \xe2\x80\x9cCreepin'\xe2\x80\x9d before, but it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to hear it again."""
b'Call Super',7.6,b'Fabric 92',0,b'Electronic',b'February 21 2017',"b'The London DJ born\xc2\xa0Joseph Richmond Seaton crafts a set that channels Fabric\xe2\x80\x99s late-hours ambience, when things get weird and wooly.'","b'At its best, a\xc2\xa0nightclub can be a scale model of utopia, a shared hallucination, an alternate reality that lasts as long as the house lights stay dark. The same holds true for mix CDs. Most merely operate as calling cards for the DJ making them, or flyers for the club promoting them. Occasionally, though, they aspire to be something more ambitious: a postcard from that imaginary place that the best club nights conjure into being out of sheer force of collective will.' b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the context in which Call Super\xe2\x80\x99s Fabric 92 comes to us. The London DJ, aka Joseph Richmond Seaton, says that he intended the release\xc2\xa0as a snapshot of the late hours of his sets, when consensus floor-fillers give way to stranger, more personal selections. That\xe2\x80\x99s one unusual thing about the mix; another is that it was born in the wild, but raised in captivity, as it were. His choice of theme and mood reflects a careful study of Fabric\xe2\x80\x99s mix series as much as it does his time in the booth at the London venue. Noticing that the late hours seemed \xe2\x80\x9cstrangely under represented\xe2\x80\x9d within the series, he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it would be good to start there instead of using this opportunity to add another peak-time chapter to the collection.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Commercial mix CDs have lost the central role in DJ culture that they enjoyed in the \xe2\x80\x9990s and \xe2\x80\x9900s; thanks to the internet, mixes are everywhere now, and free. But, perhaps precisely because no one has time to listen to even a fraction of them, Fabric\xe2\x80\x99s series is more of a canon-maker than ever. Fabric 92 is, above all, a testament to digging widely and without prejudice. Beneath house and techno\xe2\x80\x99s broad umbrella, it\xe2\x80\x99s as diverse a set as you\xe2\x80\x99ll find, spanning multiple eras, styles, and scenes, and boasting a final 14 minutes that veers way out into the deep end, from drone to country blues to polemical dancehall reggae.' b'Seaton\xe2\x80\x99s selections are spellbinding, as\xc2\xa0every track presents a self-contained world of its own. Some, like Don\xe2\x80\x99t DJ\xe2\x80\x99s polyrhythmic \xe2\x80\x9cPornoire,\xe2\x80\x9d are wildly complex; others, like the flickering electro of Shanti Celeste\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cStrung Up,\xe2\x80\x9d are relatively tidy. The cumulative effect of the way he layers and strings them all together is akin to moving through a series of wormholes, flashing from landscape to landscape while standing in place. His mixing is never ostentatious, but it generally emphasizes action. It\xe2\x80\x99s rare that a song is left to play out unaccompanied; far more often, he\xe2\x80\x99s got two and even three tracks running in parallel, resulting in a dynamic, shape-shifting fusion that\xe2\x80\x99s far more than the sum of its parts. Early on, he combines muted, shuffling cuts from Jan Jelinek and from Wolfgang Voigt\xe2\x80\x99s M:I:5 project to mossy\xc2\xa0effect, as though burrowing through underbrush, while using the doleful trumpet of Beatrice Dillon and Rupert Clervaux\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Same River Twice\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0to draw bright, silvery streaks overhead.' b'A few tracks later, following an early climax brought on by his friend Objekt\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Stitch-Up\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94whipcracks, shrapnel, a heart-in-mouth ostinato\xe2\x80\x94he turns to relatively obscure, mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s cuts from Photek and Two Full Minds to create a subaquatic atmosphere. That relative calm sets up the mix\xe2\x80\x99s most white-knuckled passage, in which Flanger\xe2\x80\x99s head-scratching \xe2\x80\x9cSpinner,\xe2\x80\x9d in 10/4 time, is teased in and out of Carl Craig\xe2\x80\x99s epic \xe2\x80\x9cA Wonderful Life\xe2\x80\x9d for three minutes of tug-of-war. At several points, it feels like it could all collapse into the mud at any moment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely that sense of risk that\xe2\x80\x99s so exhilarating.' b""On the downhill slope, Seaton switches into a more sentimental gear, leaning heavily on melodic IDM and electro from Marco Bernardi, Jega, Shanti Celeste, and Bitstream; concluding with a fleet-footed Detroit techno skip from Convextion, this might be the set\xe2\x80\x99s most satisfying segment. But Seaton has one final trick up his sleeve. As Convextion\xe2\x80\x99s beats fade away, a pair of ambient drones from Karen Gwyer and Thomas Ankersmit & Valerio Tricoli shimmer brightly in the darkness, and a lilting, sing-song speaking voice rings out: \xe2\x80\x9cWell I\xe2\x80\x99m just walkin\xe2\x80\x99/I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find the end/But every time I stop/Look like my trouble just begin.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s Walter Brown's \xe2\x80\x9cKeep on\xc2\xa0Walkin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d an a cappella country blues recorded in Mississippi in 1981 by a pair of German ethnomusicologists."" b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the first time that archival blues has turned up in dance music\xe2\x80\x94Moby, you may recall, built his empire on wringing as much authenticity as he could out of vintage recordings of black Americans\xe2\x80\x99 voices. But Seaton\xe2\x80\x99s approach, which sets Brown\xe2\x80\x99s rueful blues in an imaginary summer night, lit only by stars and fireflies, is far stranger. And in the context of a club set, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing short of audacious. Eventually, Yves Tumor\xe2\x80\x99s woozy, soulful \xe2\x80\x9cThe Feeling When You Walk Away\xe2\x80\x9d takes us by the hand and leads us back toward the light, and Speng Bond\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCutbacks,\xe2\x80\x9d a dancehall reggae tune about economic austerity policies, sends us home feeling righteous. But for just a moment there, at the tail end of the set\xe2\x80\x99s spellbinding denouement, everything falls silent as Walter Brown\xe2\x80\x99s plaintive voice carries on unaccompanied: \xe2\x80\x9cOn my knees, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna just/Keep on walkin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d In a journey full of left turns and switchbacks, this calm, quiet testament to faith and fortitude speaks the loudest; it\xe2\x80\x99s a moment when absolutely anything feels possible.'"
b'Earthen Sea',8.1,b'An Act of Love',0,b'Electronic',b'February 21 2017',b'The minimal dub-techno landscapes that Jacob Long makes as Earthen Sea carry a sense of refinement and grace. Each element of his Kranky debut is radiant.',"b'It\xe2\x80\x99s rare to have any vocals appear on of the fog-enshrouded landscapes that Jacob Long devises as Earthen Sea. But earlier this month, Long cleared out his hard drive with A Serious Thing, a nine-track compilation of tracks recorded in the past three years (with all proceeds going to the International Refugee Assistance Project, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and the National Lawyers Guild). Less than a minute in, the voice of firebrand gay Harlem intellectual James Baldwin emerges from the mists and speaks of the crucial role of dreamers\xc2\xa0in their respective societies. \xe2\x80\x9cThe poets (by which I mean all artists) are finally the only people who know the truth about us,\xe2\x80\x9d Baldwin said. \xe2\x80\x9cSoldiers don\xe2\x80\x99t, statesmen don\xe2\x80\x99t, priests don\xe2\x80\x99t, union leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t. Only the poets.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'And while there are no words and no voices that appear on An Act of Love, Long\xe2\x80\x99s debut for Kranky, that poet\xe2\x80\x99s search for an undeniable truth powers the eight breathtaking tracks that appear here. A hardcore veteran who\xe2\x80\x99s played in D.C. bands like Amalgamation and Black Eyes, Long later played bass in the adventurous punk act Mi Ami. Over time, that trio mutated from art-rock towards the sounds of Chicago house and Jamaican dub, soon splintering into three separate electronic acts: drummer Damon Palermo became Magic Touch and guitarist Daniel Martin-McCormick became Ital.' b'Long himself took the foundations of dub as the starting point for his next iteration, Earthen Sea. Much like the godfathers of minimal techno\xe2\x80\x94Moritz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus, Vladislav Delay circa Multila,\xc2\xa0the entire Chain Reaction roster\xe2\x80\x94Long realized there was sublimity to be had in endless reverb, delay, and its sonic residue. And with 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Mirage, released on Martin-McCormick\xe2\x80\x99s Lovers Rock label, Earthen Sea\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic solidified. An Act of Love is a continuation of that effort, though there\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling\xc2\xa0of refinement and awareness that gives each element here a heightened radiance. Even in the buzzing static and air organ chords that comprise beatless opener \xe2\x80\x9cThe Present Mist,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of grace, of deep breaths being drawn musically that makes it standout from other ambient noise of its ilk.' b'Earthen Sea makes\xc2\xa0minimal dub techno, but while Long\xe2\x80\x99s components are suggestive of dance music\xe2\x80\x94especially the 707 that drives most of the tracks\xe2\x80\x94the context for each programmed hit seems to not be a packed club. Rather, Earthen Sea could soundtrack\xc2\xa0a depopulated metropolis, each beat bouncing off of concrete. A squelchy kick drives \xe2\x80\x9cAbout That Time\xe2\x80\x9d and other elements wash in: a canned clap, a tapped ride cymbal, a piano line as contemplative and sonorous as that of Harold Budd. But underneath all of that is a gloriously slow swell of white noise, which rises and falls like an incoming tide and is mesmerizing in and of itself.' b'The muffled \xe2\x80\x9cApparent Lushness\xe2\x80\x9d sounds as if it was recorded four feet underwater, its pretty melody reminiscent of something off of J\xc3\xbcrgen M\xc3\xbcller\xe2\x80\x99s Science of the Sea, shining through the ripples. It segues into the centerpiece \xe2\x80\x9cExuberant Burning,\xe2\x80\x9d with Long taking a flare of feedback and making it arc across the sky like a vapor trail. A bass throbs along with the beat, and these elements all hover in place before Long adds live drums and cymbals, and moves the track forward again. A sound not unlike the distant roar of passing cars on a highway comes up, giving the track an uncanny sense of space.' b'After a brief interlude, the album peaks with the muscular kick of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Flats 1975,\xe2\x80\x9d breaking out of the noirish mood of the previous tracks and offering up a sense of much-needed physical release. In the press materials\xc2\xa0for the album, Long noted that the months leading up to the recording of An Act of Love were \xe2\x80\x9cthe most emotionally difficult and stressful year in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d which might be a sentiment shared by most people in the calendar year of 2016. But despite the darkness that intrudes in on the album\xe2\x80\x94from the inky cover to the gloaming sounds within to the despairing environment in which it now enters our present day\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s nevertheless a small kernel of hope to be gleaned. Long goes on to discuss the inspiration he got from empty city streets in the dead of night and the realization that regardless there are still people all around, as well as \xe2\x80\x9cthe openness and possibilities that [they] can bring.\xe2\x80\x9d While Long only uses a steady beat and some deeply resonant chords to convey this revelation, he nevertheless moves like a poet to unearth that heartening sense of truth here.'"

Ever since, the dance-pop project has been a conduit for her zany, freewheeling impulses as a songwriter and producer. And with her second album, more than ever, she\xe2\x80\x99s prioritizing her endearing peculiarity over any sort of run at stardom.' b'Field of Love is an obvious lurch forward from her debut, which at times had Thompson-Hannant coddling some of her quirks in appeasing, indistinct production. By contrast, the instrumentation on the new record is daring, aggressively bubbly, and sharp. As an extension of her love-buzzed lyrics, which can turn from schmoopy to demented in a single line, Thompson-Hannant\xe2\x80\x99s voice has always been unhinged: whooping, cooing breathily, even intoning baby sounds. The beats she\xe2\x80\x99s produced on Field of Love, meanwhile, flirt with unabashed garishness and fully match the whimsy of her vocal theatrics like never before.' b'The first several songs on *Field of Love *set a fizzy tone, with lead-off track \xe2\x80\x9cEternally Girl\xe2\x80\x9d pushing front-and-center synths that twinkle and plunk over tight, driving kicks. Here and throughout, Thompson-Hannant disarms with a suggestive charm, pre-ordaining an entire relationship from a pang of romance: \xe2\x80\x9cI could be the one that you love,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings in a soaring alto, before immediately promising, \xe2\x80\x9cI will be the one that you love.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a song about feeling like a little girl in love and embracing that excitement instead of qualifying or suppressing it.' b'Through Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s Sister, Thompson-Hannant has written about romance both fiercely and daintily\xe2\x80\x94at turns and at once\xe2\x80\x94often amplifying the heart\xe2\x80\x99s whims rather than trivializing them. \xe2\x80\x9cThe minute we sat down to dinner I knew,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings on \xe2\x80\x9cMoment 2\xc2\xa0Moment,\xe2\x80\x9d explaining how a new couple didn\xe2\x80\x99t even need to order drinks before adding, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know how rare that is.\xe2\x80\x9d For all her aggressive vulnerability, Thompson-Hannant sometimes drops the sentimentality for a colder edge. On \xe2\x80\x9cPlastic Memories,\xe2\x80\x9d a tweaked-out and pounding dance track, she compartmentalizes a breakup in order to leave it behind, hushing, \xe2\x80\x9cHappy goes away, so does the pain.\xe2\x80\x9d On the same song she leans in and chants savagely, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a death messenger, things that have happened are gone.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a jarring, fist-pump-worthy epiphany, a promise to live in the moment.' b'Toward the end of the album, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Heart Is Wild\xe2\x80\x9d reprises an originally stunted song called \xe2\x80\x9cMy House Is Wild\xe2\x80\x9d that first appeared on Thompson-Hannant\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 debut LP, Being. The original covered up a sincere invitation with clunky industrial production, but \xe2\x80\x9cMy Heart Is Wild\xe2\x80\x9d peels down to the core of the song\xe2\x80\x94Thompson-Hannant\xe2\x80\x99s voice, which she samples, triggers, and unleashes with giddy hope. The new version sounds less guarded, like she\xe2\x80\x99s singing and dancing manically about love at a wide-open sky instead of to a dark, throbbing dancefloor. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same effect she nurses throughout Field of Love, doubling down on her gut whims, newly confident. The record reads like a manifesto\xe2\x80\x94a pronouncement that anxiety and empowerment can dovetail, that vulnerability can be menacing, and, of course, that love can be infectiously weird.'"
b'Visible Cloaks',8.7,b'Reassemblage',1,b'Electronic',b'February 20 2017',"b'Visible Cloaks\xe2\x80\x99 hard-to-classify ambient music is a fascinating mix of organic and synthetic, past and future.'","b'So far, Spencer Doran\xe2\x80\x99s mixtapes have overshadowed his actual albums. In 2010, the Portland, Oregon, producer posted Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo\xe2\x80\x94Fourth-World Japan, Years 1980\xe2\x80\x931986, a stunning collection of early-\xe2\x80\x9980s Japanese synthesizer music by artists like Yellow Magic Orchestra\xe2\x80\x99s Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto. While not a party-starting DJ set, it was in its own meticulous, contemplative way, influential; you can hear its sensibility course through later works by the likes of Oneohtrix Point Never, Neon Indian, Motion Graphics, and the entire vaporwave contingency. A second volume followed, as did another series, Music Interiors, cementing Doran\xe2\x80\x99s status as an innovative curator of now-obscure sounds.' b'But despite the bubbling ambience and generally high quality of Doran and partner Ryan Carlile\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 debut album as Visible Cloaks, the initial full-length was overshadowed by the earlier mixes.\xc2\xa0On their second album, Reassemblage, however, the duo fully absorb these far-flung influences, weaving the strands into something delicate yet decidedly original. Lullaby-like though compositionally rigorous, serene but slightly unsettled, organic and synthetic, Reassemblage strikes an intriguing balance between extremes.' b'Like Daniel Lopatin, James Ferraro, and Laurel Halo did during the short reign of Hippos in Tanks at the start of the decade, Visible Cloaks scrutinize the once-novel digital sounds that now riddle modern pop and envelop us in our everyday lives. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t call Visible Cloaks \xe2\x80\x9cvaporwave\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94if anything, Reassemblage is the antithesis of that trend. While on the surface there is a shared obsession with the cleanliness of early digital music and the Japanese pop culture that helped usher it\xc2\xa0in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s, what Doran and Carlile do with the\xc2\xa0raw material stands apart.' b""Scroll through the Discogs page for vaporwave and almost any title bears either a visual wink or track title that mimics Japanese script. As an Esquire piece proclaiming that vaporwave was dead posited last year, the genre itself was a \xe2\x80\x9cmusical parody of pop consciousness\xe2\x80\xa6 [a] sarcastic take on the unachieved utopias of previous decades.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0But as Fairlights, Mallets, and Bamboo showed, there was a deeper investigation into the music beyond a mocking appropriation of a cool surface. The title itself comes from Vietnamese filmmaker/theorist Trinh T. Minh-ha's 1982 film Reassemblage, a documentary filmed in Senegal that doubles as a tacit admission that one can\xc2\xa0never fully decipher another culture. While never able to fully grasp the Japanese sounds they adore, Visible Cloaks nevertheless have created an album along the axis of Fennesz\xe2\x80\x99s Endless Summer and OPN\xe2\x80\x99s Replica, an abstract electronic album that\xe2\x80\x99s readily accessible and an immersive listen."" b'Visible Cloaks specialize in blurring boundaries, as they collapse organic sounds into precisely machined new shapes. \xe2\x80\x9cMask\xe2\x80\x9d works from a palette closest to those Root Strata mixes, as gamelan bowls, bird calls, and vocodered hums are stretched and processed like a Fennesz track. \xe2\x80\x9cTerrazzo\xe2\x80\x9d has Doran and Carlile team up with Motion Graphics\xe2\x80\x99 Joe Williams, taking his flute and elongating it until it more closely resembles a shakuhachi bamboo version. Around this timbre, the duo stir a marsh of small blips, twinkling crystals, and koto strings, a strange sensation of natural ambience and glitching electronics blending into an alien landscape.' b'Even when working with thoroughly synthetic tones, Cloaks tease them out so that they clench and exhale, emerging as digital blips that seem as natural as breath. Water sounds gush out of \xe2\x80\x9cScreen,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather than replicate new age nature sounds, the frequencies become high and crinkled, like the baldly fake cellophane sea of Frederico Fellini\xe2\x80\x99s And the Ship Sails On. \xe2\x80\x9cValve\xe2\x80\x9d continues with that gentle pacing, this time featuring the crystalline vocals of Miyako Koda, one-half of Japanese elegant \xe2\x80\x9980s group Dip in the Pool. Curiously, the group didn\xe2\x80\x99t factor into any of Doran\xe2\x80\x99s mixes, but \xe2\x80\x9cValve\xe2\x80\x9d sounds like a lost Bamboo selection with its deliberate mallets and misty chords. Koda is the perfect fit here and the duo shadows her already gossamer voice with what might be puffs of steam on glass rods.' b'Water, glass, cellophane, crystals, glass\xe2\x80\x94these metaphors suggest sound that can at once seem transparent and featureless. But Visible Cloaks take pains to pivot their compositions every so often, so that light catches off the sleek edges and a full spectrum of color suddenly appears. And as the album glides along, Cloaks moves away from the easy Hosono and Sakamoto comparisons. \xe2\x80\x9cCircle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with its slivers of voices, strings, and woodwinds\xe2\x80\x94sounds exacting in its every gesture, bringing to mind modern composition rather than laptop mincing. \xe2\x80\x9cNeume\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94named for an early form of musical notation\xe2\x80\x94finds the Cloaks collaborating with fellow Portlander Matt Carlson. They Auto-Tune his voice, but also warp it until he starts to resemble the polyphonic chants of a medieval organum. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of Reassemblage\xe2\x80\x99s loveliest moments and reveals Visible Cloaks\xe2\x80\x99 essential appeal, not where\xc2\xa0East meets West so much as where ancient music anticipates\xc2\xa0its digital future.'"

While never a megastar, Joe has proved himself one of the most resilient rappers of all time, with a lengthy career spanning\xc2\xa0Big Punisher, Ja Rule, and DJ Khaled. At a point, he looked to be one of those old icons, like Snoop Dogg, whose stature seemingly grandfathered him into radio play for life. But then the hits dried up. Before his comeback single with Remy Ma \xe2\x80\x9cAll the Way Up\xe2\x80\x9d returned him to the charts last year and earned a pair of Grammy nominations, it had been nearly seven years since Joe released his last commercial album, and almost a full decade since his last Top 40 hit.' b'In truth, \xe2\x80\x9cAll the Way Up\xe2\x80\x9d would have been a hit with or without him. It\xe2\x80\x99s primarily a showcase for Cool & Dre\xe2\x80\x99s deliriously celebratory beat and a never-better feature from\xc2\xa0French Montana, which makes it a Fat Joe hit in the same way that \xe2\x80\x9cFuckin\xe2\x80\x99 Problems\xe2\x80\x9d was an A$AP Rocky hit. No matter the means, though, a smash on this scale is a major feat for any rapper. And so on Plata o Plomo, the belated follow-up to 2010\xe2\x80\x99s The Darkside, Vol. 1, Joe goes to almost superstitious extremes trying repeat that single\xe2\x80\x99s formula. He brings on Remy Ma as an equal partner, recruits Cool & Dre as primary producers, and invites\xc2\xa0back French Montana for its second single, \xe2\x80\x9cCookin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite his best efforts, lightning does not strike twice.' b'Joe\xe2\x80\x99s great gambit is going halfsies with Remy Ma. Her own career was limping along before \xe2\x80\x9cAll the Way Up,\xe2\x80\x9d and the two had previously scored the biggest hit of their respective careers together\xe2\x80\x942004\xe2\x80\x99s inescapable \xe2\x80\x9cLean Back\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so it figures they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to view each other as lucky rabbits\xe2\x80\x99 feet. And recently, other New York rap lifers have found second winds with these kinds of collab albums. Smoke DZA and Pete Rock just teamed for a widely praised record, and Joell Ortiz\xc2\xa0has rarely sounded more alive than he did on his Salaam Remi-produced album last year with No Panty, his group with neighbors Bodega Bamz and Nitty Scott.' b'Collaborations like this work best when there\xe2\x80\x99s some meaningful contrast between the performers, though, and Joe and Remy Ma are too similar to establish any kind of yin/yang dynamic. Both stem from a school of New York hip-hop that values presence over personality, and they both rap with meticulous enunciation, punctuating each bar with percussive emphasis. Their voices hit like rocks on concrete. That may be catnip for some diehard New York rap enthusiasts, but for younger listeners who came up with the nimble, free-form expression of modern Atlanta rap, that delivery can feel downright arthritic. What scans as hard for one generation of hip-hop fans just scans as stiff to another.' b'And while Joe can bend just enough to fit different styles\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing it since he was biting Das EFX flows on his 1993 debut Represent, riggity-riggity-rather blatantly\xe2\x80\x94Remy is inflexible to a fault. She assumes a default battle stance even on songs that in no way call for it, like Ty Dolla $ign\xe2\x80\x99s smooth \xe2\x80\x9980s R&B homage \xe2\x80\x9cMoney Showers,\xe2\x80\x9d or the Sevyn Streeter-featuring DeBarge/Blackstreet flip \xe2\x80\x9cGo Crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d She still continues to rap about shitting on her enemies, too. She does it on two different tracks.' b'Plata o Plomo does feature one strong single candidate: the Caribbean-flavored the-Dream feature \xe2\x80\x9cHeartbreak.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe delivers his loosest performance in years, and for once even Remy Ma unwinds a bit and breaks out the suntan lotion. But more representative of the album\xe2\x80\x99s conservative approach is the mid-album champagne clink \xe2\x80\x9cHow Long.\xe2\x80\x9d The song\xe2\x80\x99s yawn of a chorus is supposed to be a boast about their veteran status\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHow long?/How long?/How long we been getting to the money?/How long?/How long we been gettin\xe2\x80\x99 it?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94yet through sheer repetition it becomes a kind of commentary on their songwriting: How long have we been rapping about this?

Here, on his second release since then, the Dutch producer offers future directions but none as captivating as his start.""","b'Fatima Yamaha\xe2\x80\x99s new Araya EP would not exist without persistent cheerleading from a few impressively dedicated followers. The Dutch producer Bas Bron released a record as Yamaha in 2004 and then appeared done with the name. He continued to put out records under other pseudonyms\xe2\x80\x94Bastian, Seymour Bits\xe2\x80\x94and run his Magnetron label. The results of the Yamaha experiment, a four-track EP titled A Girl Between Two Worlds, seemed like a one-off curio.' b""But over time, those who heard the EP became smitten. In particular, they swooned over \xe2\x80\x9cWhat's a Girl to Do?,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0with its sprightly synthesizers and existential-crisis dialog sampled from Lost In Translation. Two labels, D1 Recordings and Dekmantel, eventually released\xc2\xa0the song; another devotee, producer Hudson Mohawke, included Yamaha's tune in an Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1 in 2009 and used it as the basis for \xe2\x80\x9cResistance,\xe2\x80\x9d a new track featuring Jhen\xc3\xa9 Aiko, in 2015."" b'This put Bron in a strange spot: a Def Jam vocalist with Top 40 cred was singing one of Yamaha\xe2\x80\x99s melodies, but Yamaha barely existed. So Bron pulled the moniker out of mothballs and released the LP Imaginary Lines in 2015. He could have done anything he wanted\xe2\x80\x94he was hardly constrained by precedent\xe2\x80\x94but he decided to stay faithful to his most hardcore fans. Imaginary Lines mostly picked up where *A Girl Between Two Worlds *left off, maintaining a handsome balance between fluffy and driving. Movie-score atmospheres sit easily next to songs like \xe2\x80\x9cLove Invaders,\xe2\x80\x9d with its resistance-is-futile grip recalling crackerjack pop songs.' b""In contrast, the three tracks on Araya represent a swivel away from the accessibility that earned Yamaha ardent admirers. Though \xe2\x80\x9cPiayes Beach Bar and Grill\xe2\x80\x9d has plenty of dinky electric snap, it avoids any head-rush moments: the synths never achieve peak friskiness, there\xe2\x80\x99s no sample lying in wait to ambush the listener and suddenly transform the song's final quarter. The track ends during the middle of a showy solo, so you get the annoyance of indulgence without the triumphant, ascend-the-scale payoff."" b""\xe2\x80\x9cRomantic Bureaucracy\xe2\x80\x9d maintains distance in a different way; it has the exclusive feel of an inside joke. The song plays like a response to \xe2\x80\x9cLove's Got Me High,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9990s floor-wrecker produced by Detroit stalwart Terrence Parker. As one piano lays out a simple groove similar to the one that carried Parker\xe2\x80\x99s track, Bron adds criss-crossing clusters of keyboard notes\xe2\x80\x94sonic paperwork\xe2\x80\x94on top. A beat never arrives to cut through all the red tape."" b""Still, Bron can't help but make something hard to shake\xe2\x80\x94that quality, after all, is what kept the Yamaha spark alive for all these years. In that vein, *Araya\xe2\x80\x99*s title track is crisp and chipper, with a commanding melody ricocheting playfully across a stern, \xe2\x80\x9980s-pop low-end. It's not much of a leap from here to the work of a more mainstream producer like Eric Prydz. There's a pair of especially pleasing moments around the song\xe2\x80\x99s four-minute mark: a light drum beats out a military rat-a-tat behind the primary melody just as it finishes one strafing run and prepares to begin another pass. This is a great trick for stakes-raising that you can also find in hits like Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAscension (Don't Ever\xc2\xa0Wonder).\xe2\x80\x9d"" b'Bron needs these overtly gratifying tracks\xe2\x80\x94without them, Yamaha wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have picked up boosters, and the project would have remained a quirky singularity. But even with \xe2\x80\x9cAraya,\xe2\x80\x9d this EP makes you wonder about Yamaha\xe2\x80\x99s status. First the persona inspired a minor cult; then it stormed back as a small-scale dancefloor hero.

The\xc2\xa0European duo keeps pushing the outer limits of noise and techno further on this excellent new collage of songs.',"b'Berlin-based Finnish producers Ville Haimala and Martti Kalliala first made waves in 2011 as Renaissance Man, an impish electro duo equal parts quirky energy and bleary-eyed techno. The producers have since discarded that shell, reinventing themselves as Amnesia Scanner, a brutalist avant-club project whose music is engineered to alienate and provoke. In loose dialog with dance deconstructionists like Arca, Angel-Ho, and Lotic, Amnesia Scanner\xe2\x80\x99s violently kinetic club visions deal in the dissonant and the absurd, all the while glimpsing hellish dystopian wastelands and the disorientation of future shock.' b'Since 2014\xe2\x80\x99s AS LIVE [][][][][] and the following year\xe2\x80\x99s AS ANGELS RIG HOOK, Amnesia Scanner have been crumpling grime, trap, rave and various regional dance strains into one convulsive, machine-like knot. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s *AS *EP, Amnesia Scanner\xe2\x80\x99s first official physical release, dialed back on the aggression ever so slightly, distilling the duo\xe2\x80\x99s inclination for shrapnel textures and keening electronics into comparatively shorter, more accessible bursts. The duo\xe2\x80\x99s latest, the *AS TRUTH *mixtape, flips the script once again\xe2\x80\x94Amnesia Scanner has never sounded this abstract, this exceptionally unstable.' b'AS TRUTH\xe2\x80\x99s artwork depicts a lobotomy\xe2\x80\x94what looks like a forced lobotomy, to be specific. The victim appears resigned to his fate, looking confused, dejected, but also angry. In turn, the viewer is forced to share in that terrifying scene, in that discomfort, in that fear. Similarly, AS TRUTH feels like a music that\xe2\x80\x99s flung at you, forced on you\xe2\x80\x94something that not so much asks to be interpreted\xc2\xa0as reaches out and grabs at your attention, in thrilling, if deeply unnerving, ways.\xc2\xa0Throughout its 15 unbroken minutes, the mixtape hurls listeners into a bramble of juxtaposing textures and timbres. Hi-tech, high-gloss sounds clash up against coarse, serrated ones; needling dissonance rubs shoulders with creaky silences. Synths screech and squeal, bellow and gurgle. The percussion flits between skittering, frenzied beat-programming and concussive thunder. Shards of disembodied vocals are interspersed throughout the mixtape, reduced at turns to melting, pitch-shifted ooze and flinty cries. Seemingly brittle one moment, colossally impenetrable the next, AS TRUTH\xe2\x80\x99s angular shapes move in fits and starts, like some cybernetic albatross still searching for its sea legs.' b'AS TRUTH\xe2\x80\x99s tracklist outlines seven individual cuts, but simultaneously released on SoundCloud and Bandcamp as a single unsegmented stream, the mixtape functions as one long-form work without noticeable seams. Apart from the back-to-back midsection deluge of \xe2\x80\x9cAS TRUTH\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAS BRIETH\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94released as a two-sided single last December\xe2\x80\x94*AS TRUTH *consists of all new material. It starts with a wail\xe2\x80\x94part marine air horn, part digital leviathan stirring to life\xe2\x80\x94and closes with a throaty exhale. In between lives some of the most radical and ear-splitting electronic music you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely encounter all year. From opener \xe2\x80\x9cAS POWERLESS,\xe2\x80\x9d with its helicopter flicker and haunted rave theme, to outro \xe2\x80\x9cAS SANE\xe2\x80\x9d, which is of a piece with OPN\xe2\x80\x99s Garden of Delete, AS TRUTH never fails to confound. It\xe2\x80\x99s a release of ferocious intensity, constructed from an unwieldy set of moving, interconnected parts. Vestiges of melody and rhythm are teased here and there, but no sooner do they gain footing than they collapse in on themselves, receding back into the maelstrom.' b'Yet, for all its noise and frenzy, AS TRUTH also contains some of the slowest-paced and quiet music Amnesia Scanner has released so far. Take the funereal ambient of \xe2\x80\x9cAS WEEP\xe2\x80\x9d, which breeds tension in its gaping negative spaces. Gothic harpsichord, computerized plinks, slurred vocals,\xc2\xa0and muted drums are all that cut through the silences. However, this proves to be just another of Amnesia Scanner\xe2\x80\x99s clever devices: they lull you into a false sense of serenity, just so they can later spring a noisy trap.'"

In one scene, the members of the Ohio new wave group haul toxic waste in a flatbed truck down a lonesome highway. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the world today,\xe2\x80\x9d Devo\xe2\x80\x99s Booji Boy says to himself as images of skulls flash across his bandmates\xe2\x80\x99 faces, \xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to care about their fellow man.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'This is where Neil Young\xe2\x80\x99s head was at the top of the \xe2\x80\x9980s. Human Highway\xe2\x80\x94Young\xe2\x80\x99s third picture, following the psychedelic Journey Through the Past and his quasi-concert film Rust Never Sleeps\xe2\x80\x94shares a title with a song from 1978\xe2\x80\x99s Comes a Time. \xe2\x80\x9cTake my head, and change my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he sang in its chorus, \xe2\x80\x9cHow could people get so unkind?.\xe2\x80\x9d With its gentle acoustic guitars and fantasies of misty mountains, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Highway\xe2\x80\x9d plays like a eulogy to a specific type of Neil Young song. The Canadian hippie who sings in a high squeaky voice about packin\xe2\x80\x99 it in and buyin\xe2\x80\x99 a pick-up is only one side of Young. In fact, a decade into his solo career, Neil Young had developed a reputation more like an actor, someone remembered more for the parts he played than the unifying presence behind them all. After Comes a Time, he stepped away from his role as a \xe2\x80\x9970s folk singer, with 1979\xe2\x80\x99s Rust Never Sleeps introducing a decade of restless exploration. The world was getting meaner, and Neil Young was tired of being typecast as merely an observer: He wanted to take part in the madness.' b'Although they both speak to the increasingly uneasy state of Young\xe2\x80\x99s mind, \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Highway,\xe2\x80\x9d the song, never appears in Human Highway, the film. Instead, the movie is mostly soundtracked by a record called Trans, released that same year. In the film, Young gets into character by contorting his face, wearing a pair of dorky glasses, and slapping motor oil on his cheeks. On Trans, he transforms himself by setting his songs in a distant future and filtering his voice through a variety of synthesizers, most notably (and infamously) a vocoder. The warped new wave of Trans suits the movie\xe2\x80\x99s otherworldly (if endearingly chintzy) backdrops. You believe that this is the music that would play in the film\xe2\x80\x99s shoddy roadside diner, where Dennis Hopper cooks sausage patties and swats at radioactive, laser-pointer flies. In fact, the movie might be the best context to hear Trans\xe2\x80\x94an album that\xe2\x80\x99s often treated more like a symbol (for artistic reinvention, for failed experimentation, for creative self-sabotage) than an actual entry in a body of work characterized by prolificacy and versatility.' b""Part of what makes Neil Young\xe2\x80\x99s discography so rewarding for new listeners is that it\xe2\x80\x99s filled\xc2\xa0with great entry points: the classic rock radio staples with more depth than you imagined (After the Goldrush, Harvest); the intimate passages that, even after all these years, feel like uncovered secrets (Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the Night, On the Beach); and the bizarre left-turns like Trans that inspire cult fandom just for existing. And while Trans sits comfortably along with Lou Reed\xe2\x80\x99s Metal Machine Music and Bob Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s Self Portrait in a lineage of puzzling-if-fascinating failures, its mythology is only part of the appeal. Reed and Dylan always felt like provocateurs\xe2\x80\x94for Dylan, even finding Jesus felt like a means of snapping back at critics. But Young\xe2\x80\x99s transformations have always felt less divisive, more natural and earnest and instinctual. Even when he followed\xc2\xa0Trans with Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s Rockin\xe2\x80\x99, a slight collection of anti-capitalist rockabilly songs, he held the latter record in high esteem: \xe2\x80\x9cAs good as Tonight's The Night, as far as I'm concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s said."" b'Young has made similar claims about Trans. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of my favorites,\xe2\x80\x9d he said grimly, holding the album art to the camera during a 2012 interview, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you listen to this now, it makes a lot more sense than it did then.\xe2\x80\x9d Even if Trans is still confusing, it\xe2\x80\x99s a point well taken. In the context of Young\xe2\x80\x99s discography\xe2\x80\x94rich with remakes and sequels, major reunions and minor pet projects\xe2\x80\x94Trans has only grown more triumphant and singular as it\xe2\x80\x99s aged. He would do new wave again, he\xe2\x80\x99d mess with his voice some more, and he\xe2\x80\x99d even return to the idea of full-on concept albums. But he would never make anything quite so conceptually confrontational\xe2\x80\x94a challenge to even his most ardent followers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of what a Neil Young album sounds like. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I build something up, I have to systematically tear it right down,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s said, referring to his penchant for moving quickly from one project to another, carrying with him few traces of the previous work. It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable, then, that Trans\xe2\x80\x94an album ostensibly designed to \xe2\x80\x9ctear down\xe2\x80\x9d a specific image of Neil Young\xe2\x80\x94ends up standing for exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s great about him.' b'Like so many of Neil Young\xe2\x80\x99s albums, Trans is filled with mysteries and unanswered questions (Why is his 1967 Buffalo Springfield song \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Soul\xe2\x80\x9d on here? Why is a track called \xe2\x80\x9cIf You Got Love\xe2\x80\x9d listed in the lyric sheet\xc2\xa0but not on the actual album?) It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of an artist with as many classic albums who has wrestled so constantly against the medium: even his canonized work has a raw, unfinished quality to it. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything is wrong, then it\xe2\x80\x99s down to the mixing,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s said about Trans, \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a lot of technical problems on that record.\xe2\x80\x9d Fittingly, much of Trans concerns man\xe2\x80\x99s fight against technology. A song called \xe2\x80\x9cComputer Cowboy (aka Syscrusher)\xe2\x80\x9d details a team of rogue computers robbing a bank, with Young\xe2\x80\x99s voice zapped down to a digital squelch. In \xe2\x80\x9cWe R in Control,\xe2\x80\x9d a choir of robots lists the aspects of daily life\xe2\x80\x94traffic lights, the FBI, even the flow of air\xe2\x80\x94in which humans no longer have a say. Thematically, these songs\xe2\x80\x94with their dystopian images of a world run by screens and numbers, where humans have everything at their fingertips but remain unhappy\xe2\x80\x94have aged pretty well.' b""It\xe2\x80\x99s the sound of the record that makes it more of an \xe2\x80\x9980s relic. No matter what format you listen to the album on (and it\xe2\x80\x99s still never been released on CD in the U.S.), you feel as though you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing it from the tape deck of a passing car. Even with longtime collaborators like producer David Briggs, guitarist Ben Keith, and drummer Ralph Molina, these songs sound very little like Young\xe2\x80\x99s timeless \xe2\x80\x9970s work. The goofier, beat-centric tracks from his previous release, 1981\xe2\x80\x99s shaky Re-ac-tor, certainly set a precedent. But despite its reputation for being aggressive and inscrutable, Trans is, at its heart, a pop record. It\xe2\x80\x99s filled with hooks and beats and synths informed equally by krautrock and MTV. In \xe2\x80\x9cSample and Hold,\xe2\x80\x9d guitarist Nils Lofgren\xe2\x80\x94whose solos added an element of bluesy desperation to Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the Night but would soon light up football stadiums on Bruce Springsteen\xe2\x80\x99s Born in the U.S.A. tour\xe2\x80\x94points to future hits like Dire Straits\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cMoney for Nothing\xe2\x80\x9d and Oingo Boingo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWeird Science.\xe2\x80\x9d When the Trans Band played \xe2\x80\x9cSample and Hold\xe2\x80\x9d during the album\xe2\x80\x99s comically over-the-top tour\xe2\x80\x94an endeavor that Young claims in Jimmy McDonough's authorized biography Shakey lost him $750,000 (\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we sold out every show,\xe2\x80\x9d he adds)\xe2\x80\x94Neil and Nils stalk the stage with rock star charisma, trading solos and bleating into their talkboxes. In the sweet, melodic \xe2\x80\x9cTransformer Man,\xe2\x80\x9d Neil\xe2\x80\x99s vocoder actually adds an element of purity to his voice, as layers of wordless choruses shower him. Listening to these songs, it\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible to imagine that Trans could have maybe, possibly, in another world, been a pop hit."" b'But that world is in a\xc2\xa0galaxy far from this one. While the critical reception to Trans was not nearly as harsh as legend would have you think (Rolling Stone compared it to Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s Berlin Trilogy; Robert Christgau gave it a higher mark than Harvest), it was a commercial dud\xe2\x80\x94a rough start for the fledgling Geffen Records label, who also released\xc2\xa0Joni Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s adult contemporary turn\xc2\xa0Wild Things Run Fast\xc2\xa0the same year. Trans wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the album that convinced David Geffen to sue Neil Young for making uncharacteristic records\xe2\x80\x94that would be its follow-ups *Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s Rockin\xe2\x80\x99 *and Old Ways, the country record that plays like a made-for-TV adaptation of Harvest. But the idea had to be floating through David Geffen\xe2\x80\x99s head when he first heard this record. At once Young\xe2\x80\x99s coldest sounding album and his most vulnerable, Trans makes its flaws immediately apparent as soon as you press play\xe2\x80\x94from the murky production to the mixed-bag tracklist.' b'When you listen to Trans, you\xe2\x80\x99re really only hearing two-thirds of it. Only six of the album\xe2\x80\x99s nine songs were intended for the actual project. The other three came from a different album entirely, one that concerned young love and ancient civilizations. It was to be titled Island in the Sun, and Geffen Records quickly steered him away from the concept. Album opener \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Thing Called Love\xe2\x80\x9d stems from those sessions, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the record\xe2\x80\x99s clearest connection to Young\xe2\x80\x99s more celebrated talents. Its chorus riffs on the title of one of his most beloved songs (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly love,\xe2\x80\x9d he barks in a chipper tone, \xe2\x80\x9cBrings you the blues\xe2\x80\x9d) and the ensuing chord progression would eventually find a new home in the title track of 1992\xe2\x80\x99s Harvest Moon. While demonstrating the fluidity of Neil\xe2\x80\x99s catalog, the song also makes for a striking introduction in its own right: a singalong before the apocalypse, when human connection would become as archaic as LaserDisc copies of the Solo Trans live show are today.' b'The Island songs also help highlight a major theme of Trans: it\xe2\x80\x99s an album about affection. At the start of the decade, Neil Young and his wife were enrolled in intensive therapy with their son Ben, who had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The program\xe2\x80\x99s long hours slowed Young\xe2\x80\x99s hectic work schedule and opened him up to writing about fatherhood. His struggles to communicate with his child and the technology that connected them inspired the lyrics of Trans and even informed the way he recorded his vocals: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t understand the words, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand my son\xe2\x80\x99s words,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained in Shakey. In that context, Young\xe2\x80\x99s naked voice in respective side-openers \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Thing Called Love\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHold on to Your Love\xe2\x80\x9d represents the catharsis of an emotional breakthrough. You understand the words he wants you to understand\xe2\x80\x94and most of them just say, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""Even with Human Highway serving as a vehicle for the album, Trans was originally conceived with a different film project in mind. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a big concept,\xe2\x80\x9d Young said in Shakey, \xe2\x80\x9cAll of the electronic-voice people were working in a hospital, and the one thing they were trying to do is teach this little baby to push a button.\xe2\x80\x9d That metaphor pops up a few times throughout the record, most squarely in \xe2\x80\x9cTransformer Man,\xe2\x80\x9d a song Young's openly dedicated to his son. \xe2\x80\x9cYou run the show,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDirect the action with the push of a button.\xe2\x80\x9d The Trans film might not have moved the album to the commercial heights Neil and Geffen imagined, but available evidence suggests that it would have at least made its digital world feel warmer, more grounded and productive\xe2\x80\x94the qualities fans had come to expect from Young\xe2\x80\x99s work. Instead, the songs would have to stand on their own, their meaning buried inside them, like a constellation of stars you have to connect based on your own perception."" b'Near the end of Human Highway, a concussed Young enters a long, inscrutable dream sequence in which he, among other things, gets bathed in milk, attends a desert ritual, and becomes a world-renowned rock star. When Russ Tamblyn wakes him, they celebrate the mere fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s alive. For the film\xe2\x80\x99s final 10 minutes, Neil lives with a newfound sense of purpose and ambition (\xe2\x80\x9cWe could do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe could be rhythm and bluesers, we could go on the road!\xe2\x80\x9d). Even with the fiery explosion on its way to squash his dreams and reduce the world to a pile of ash, it\xe2\x80\x99s a brighter\xc2\xa0ending than what Trans leaves us with. In the lost paradise of \xe2\x80\x9cLike an Inca,\xe2\x80\x9d Young envisions himself in the aftermath of a nuclear bomb, crossing the bridge to the afterlife, at once happy and sad and totally alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fitting finale for a heavy album, one whose only brief glimmers of hope come from our connection to one another. \xe2\x80\x9cI need you to let me know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a heartbeat/Let it pound and pound,\xe2\x80\x9d Young sings in \xe2\x80\x9cComputer Age.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice is masked beyond recognition, but the pulse\xe2\x80\x94steady and wild\xe2\x80\x94is unmistakably his own.'"
b'Tinariwen',8.2,b'Elwan',0,b'Global',b'February 18 2017',"b'On their latest set, Mali\xe2\x80\x99s Tinariwen ensemble mix\xc2\xa0Western African styles, feverish group workouts, and\xc2\xa0world-weary lyrics, collaborating with Kurt Vile and Mark Lanegan in the process.'","b'Since coming to the attention of Western listeners in the 2000s, the Tuareg artists in Tinariwen have managed to keep their \xe2\x80\x9cdesert blues\xe2\x80\x9d sound intact, while varying some elements of songwriting craft. The largely acoustic aesthetic of 2011\xe2\x80\x99s Tassili saw input from American indie talents, like TV on the Radio\xe2\x80\x99s Kyp Malone and Wilco\xe2\x80\x99s Nels Cline. On 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Emmaar, Tinariwen reveled in some funkier arrangements.' b'Elwan offers another solid collection of tunes that merge West African styles and guitar riffs inspired by American folk forms. The album can swing quickly across a wide range of moods, moving dramatically between feverish group workouts and more personal, acoustic laments. And the\xc2\xa0continued\xc2\xa0political turmoil in their native northern Mali\xe2\x80\x94including the targeting of the band\xe2\x80\x99s members by\xc2\xa0Islamist militants\xe2\x80\x94has provided these songwriters with no shortage of inspiration for world-weary lyrics.' b'This time around, Tinariwen\xe2\x80\x99s collaborations\xc2\xa0work\xc2\xa0more ideally than on previous outings.\xc2\xa0Sometime Queens of the Stone Age member Alain Johannes brings his \xe2\x80\x9ccigar box guitar\xe2\x80\x9d to the grooving, communal song\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTalyat.\xe2\x80\x9d And on the uptempo opener, \xe2\x80\x9cTiw\xc3\xa0yyen,\xe2\x80\x9d guest guitarist Kurt Vile merges fully with the other members of the ensemble. During this first appearance, there\xe2\x80\x99s little sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in calling attention to himself. (The song\xe2\x80\x99s real stars are the spirited backing vocalists, who swarm during the choruses.)' b'On bassist Eyadou Ag Leche\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cN\xc3\xa0nnufl\xc3\xa0y,\xe2\x80\x9d though, Vile\xe2\x80\x99s reverb-heavy guitar tone is more easily recognized. The romanticized sense of reverie in his playing\xe2\x80\x94familiar from albums like 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Wakin on a Pretty Daze\xe2\x80\x94seems to exert a strong influence over the entire band\xe2\x80\x99s performance, thereby giving Tinariwen a new vibe to inhabit. Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, one of the group\xe2\x80\x99s principal singer-guitarists, makes the most of this opportunity, turning in a chilled-out performance that is threaded with less vocal ornamentation than usual. The final minute\xe2\x80\x99s vocals are turned over to Mark Lanegan\xe2\x80\x99s coolheaded baritone: a choice that risks merely gilding the lily, but just plain works.' b'Naturally, this core group of players doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really need any help when it comes to fashioning sublime performances. On \xe2\x80\x9cAss\xc3\xa0wt,\xe2\x80\x9d acoustic arpeggios are sometimes joined by darts of electric-guitar filigree\xe2\x80\x94a mirroring of the way the song\xe2\x80\x99s solo vocalist routinely welcomes a chorus of companions by his side. Elsewhere, the propulsive rock energy of \xe2\x80\x9cSastan\xc3\xa0qq\xc3\xa0m\xe2\x80\x9d leavens the mood for a spell, while the mantra of \xe2\x80\x9cIttus\xe2\x80\x9d reflects a seriousness of intent. (The latter song\xe2\x80\x99s lyric reads, in its entirety: \xe2\x80\x9cI ask you, what is our goal/It is the unity of our nation/And to carry our standard high.\xe2\x80\x9d)' b'It can be tempting, at this point, to take all the strengths of Tinariwen for granted. Once again, all their music is crisply played, and smartly sequenced. Yet while Elwan may not herald any grand\xc2\xa0stylistic breakthrough, it does manage to synthesize some of the group\xe2\x80\x99s most recent experiments in a way that helps distinguish it within their overall catalog. English translations for the lyrics are available on their label\xe2\x80\x99s website, but the spirit of each song is generally discernible from the performance choices. The purpose of Tinariwen\xe2\x80\x99s music doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undergo radical redefinition\xe2\x80\x94and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to do so. From their beginnings in a refugee camp to their latest iteration as a world-touring entity, they can provide exultation\xc2\xa0and encouragement like few other ensembles, on any continent.'"
b'The Necks',8.0,b'Unfold',0,b'Experimental',b'February 18 2017',b'Australian improv trio the Necks have condensed their approach on this new double LP for\xc2\xa0Stephen O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s label. The experience\xc2\xa0feels like a ceaseless fever dream.',"b'The Necks have never been much for tracklists. With some early and not always impressive exceptions near the dawn of the group\xe2\x80\x99s almost three-decade career, the improvisational Australian trio has preferred to go the distance in one, perhaps two extended takes. For an hour or so at a time, restless drummer Tony Buck, patient bassist Lloyd Swanton, and soulful pianist and organist Chris Abrahams would slip into sound worlds of their own design and slowly morph, as if on an evolutionary timeline. Their best records, like 2001\xe2\x80\x99s essential Aether or 2013\xe2\x80\x99s consummate Open, gradually subside and swell, drive and drift. By stretching pieces past the hour mark, they could change one\xe2\x80\x99s very sense of dynamics, where tiny shifts in volume or tone or speed suddenly felt revelatory. With the Necks, it seemed, anything could happen if you listened long enough.' b'But that approach ends abruptly on Unfold, the Necks\xe2\x80\x99 19th\xc2\xa0album and first for Ideologic Organ, the label of fellow slow-motion traveler Stephen O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, of Sunn O))) fame. For this double LP, the Necks devote each of four sides to one improvisation. With runtimes between 15 and 22\xc2\xa0minutes, they\xe2\x80\x99ve chopped the typical Necks tune into thirds or quarters. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, there\xe2\x80\x99s no intended sequence for these sides, meaning you could start with the hectic, gamelan-like rumble of \xe2\x80\x9cTimepiece\xe2\x80\x9d or end there, a move that makes the entire experience feel like a ceaseless fever dream. It\xe2\x80\x99s a surprisingly indeterminate decision\xc2\xa0for a group whose output has always felt, no matter how improvisational it was, meticulous, even hermetic. Since the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s, the Necks\xe2\x80\x99 records have invariably offered micromanaged adventure; with Unfold, they let you shape your own tale by giving you tracks without a tracklist.' b'Still, all of the Necks hallmarks appear at some point during Unfold\xe2\x80\x94hyperactive drumming that expands and contracts any real sense of meter; piano lines that can summon a storm or conjure a presiding calm; bowed bass that rattles the room*.* And though the Necks look like a jazz trio, their swing is tempestuous and their approach nebulous, with touches of post-rock and soul and Stockhausen and gospel wrapped into their orchestrated mess.' b'But Unfold\xe2\x80\x99s unconventional format forces the Necks to condense its typical approach, to push and pull all the usual peaks, valleys, and arcs into more manageable spans. Everything speeds up just a bit. With\xc2\xa0that, by the end of the first two minutes of \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d the bass, drums, piano, and organ are already intertwined and active. Buck\xe2\x80\x99s distended drum rolls ricochet between layers of blue piano fragments and organ peals. And\xc2\xa0during the tumultuous \xe2\x80\x9cRise,\xe2\x80\x9d which is so disorienting that the trio seems to be playing both meter and melody inside-out, the requisite moments of calm are fleeting. Here, the Necks make you gasp for air, never allowing for time or space to breathe very deeply.' b'Splintering the usual runtime of a Necks album into four largely disconnected pieces seems like it would fragment the experience\xe2\x80\x94that is, turning a Necks record on, then disappearing inside it. Is Unfold the trio\xe2\x80\x99s first album for our ever-shortening attention spans, at least since their salad days of placid bop in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s?' b'Turns out, not at all: The Necks\xe2\x80\x99 newfound density is intoxicating. The ideas fly by in a way they never have with this band. Each compressed piece simply pushes you along to the next, eager to witness how a quarter-century-old act can again reshape your perception of drums, piano, and upright bass. After the Necks answer the psychedelic, wildly melismatic organ runs of \xe2\x80\x9cOverhear\xe2\x80\x9d with the pensive, clinched gaze of \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d hearing what else is possible becomes a compulsion. (And if you\xe2\x80\x99re new here, the quest can and should send you deep into a rich back catalog.) The relatively succinct tracks of Unfold aren\xe2\x80\x99t some cynical concession to an audience\xe2\x80\x99s fractured attention span or some attempt to become suddenly accessible. They are, instead, the result of a band that\xe2\x80\x99s always tested supposedly solid borders\xe2\x80\x94between jazz and rock, between acoustic and electric, between composition and improvisation. On Unfold, they\xe2\x80\x99ve wondered aloud if the spell of their long-form magic works when stunted by the limitations of physical media and shuffled by the will of the listener. It does.'"
b'Noveller',6.5,b'A Pink Sunset For No One',0,b'Rock',b'February 18 2017',"b'This is Sarah Lipstate\xe2\x80\x99s biggest record as Noveller yet. Mixing genres to create\xc2\xa0her epic version of noise, what it loses in detail it makes up for in grandiosity.'","b'With each successive release, the self-sustaining universe that is Sarah Lipstate\xe2\x80\x99s output as Noveller pushes outward. Her instrumental sound\xe2\x80\x94built from guitar loops run through pedals\xe2\x80\x94has evolved well past\xc2\xa0its drone-anchored early incarnation. That relied on layers of distortion to create meditative spaces that enveloped the listener; more recently, synths and percussion have entered her sprawling compositions. A Pink Sunset for No One is ruled by a newly epic sense of scale and narrative. For better or for worse, the album\xe2\x80\x99s more intricate details are at times overshadowed by its glimmering crescendos.' b'However, the tension between Noveller\xe2\x80\x99s roots as an intimate bedroom project and the outsize shape it takes here is compelling: even if her style has grown to fill the kind of rooms one might play opening for Iggy Pop, it still feels like a dreamworld Lipstate has built primarily for herself. Opener \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Shelter\xe2\x80\x9d begins with a low-pitched four-note phrase that repeats throughout, accumulating iterative details that begin to soar outward from the humble introduction. Four minutes in, these loops pull back to make way for a gently cinematic piano bridge: self-soothing, yes, but executed in a remarkably high-definition way.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also a heightened sense of energy, Lipstate spending less time luxuriating in her guitar\xe2\x80\x99s textures and more on developing big-picture structure. \xe2\x80\x9cRituals,\xe2\x80\x9d which winks at Steve Reich, is anchored by soft, distant percussion and a small chorus of staccato riffing, punctuated by blasts of rippling sustained notes. On \xe2\x80\x9cTrials and Trails,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps the album\xe2\x80\x99s most technically impressive track, Lipstate solos heroically over distorted passages, the juxtaposition throwing the liquidity of her playing into relief.' b'The variety of genres and sounds that emerge within her compositions give Lipstate\xe2\x80\x99s work a multitextured feel, but in moments I found myself wishing for more concision in the way such ideas are digested. Experimental forebears like Reich or Rhys Chatham (with whom she\xe2\x80\x99s performed, in his Guitar Army) are a natural influence, but on songs like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Unveiling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCorridors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lipstate\xe2\x80\x99s usual spaciness takes on an almost-proggy feel; meanwhile, the title track feels like a crisp take on a Slowdive instrumental. Clearly, Lipstate has the technical prowess to pull off a near-infinite range of styles. As she shakes off the distortion that might have once smoothed over their messier intersections, the issue becomes, perhaps, how to tastefully marry them.' b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a solid sense of self at this record\xe2\x80\x99s core. Its closer \xe2\x80\x9cEmergence\xe2\x80\x9d is slow but not sleepy, fluttering melodies dancing around its murky base. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to listen in to the small melodic details folded into its dominant humid texture, but it also feels, as a whole, reassuring: a sound that\xe2\x80\x99s big and confident without relying on excess to sway its listeners, or itself.'"
b'Sallie Ford',7.1,b'Soul Sick',0,b'Folk/Country',b'February 18 2017',"b'On her latest LP,\xc2\xa0Sallie Ford distills her retro rock sound and introduces a confessional lyrical approach. Soul Sick\xc2\xa0lands somewhere\xc2\xa0between between a \xe2\x80\x9950s sock hop and last call\xc2\xa0in a rockabilly bar.'","b'A retro streak runs through most of\xc2\xa0the music of Sallie Ford, both solo and with her former Portland, Oregon band the Sound Outside. But it\xe2\x80\x99s never been quite as pronounced as on her latest album. Soul Sick is Ford\xe2\x80\x99s second LP since the Sound Outside split at the end of 2013, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a distillation in many ways, as if\xc2\xa0Ford ran her\xc2\xa0songs through a rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll evaporator to remove any extraneous elements.\xc2\xa0The result is a vintage sound that falls somewhere between a 1950s sock hop and last call\xc2\xa0in a disreputable rockabilly bar.' b'Soul Sick\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa011 lean tunes are full of raucous, trebly guitars and a toughness imparted by Ford\xe2\x80\x99s raw voice. Her vocals are a distinctive blend of rugged and plaintive, and\xc2\xa0something of a calling card, one of those attributes that draws listeners in or turns them off. Either way, Ford knows her strengths as a singer, and she maximizes them here. She lets\xc2\xa0her voice ring out on \xe2\x80\x9cScrew Up\xe2\x80\x9d over a thrumming Farfisa, or conveys an itchy sense of urgency on \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out,\xe2\x80\x9d or\xc2\xa0captures the anxiety of teen angst on \xe2\x80\x9cFailure.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Despite the jumped-up, hip-shaking music, Soul Sick is not a good-time album. Ford is deceptively self-lacerating, and she\xe2\x80\x99s by turns angry and forlorn throughout. Though she sings plenty about behaving badly, a classic rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll subject, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics are anachronistic. With their stark, personal tone, these songs amount to a latter-day form of confessional songwriting that simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done in the musical periods she draws from. Her dissatisfaction sometimes veers from restless exasperation, as on the full-throated \xe2\x80\x9cGet Out,\xe2\x80\x9d to something closer to wallowing in her anguish.' b'Ford sings with jumpy force on \xe2\x80\x9cLoneliness Is Power,\xe2\x80\x9d but the lyrics read as if she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to convince herself that the title is true. She beats herself up on \xe2\x80\x9cRomanticized Catastrophe\xe2\x80\x9d for letting negative emotions run rampant, a sentiment at odds with the doo-wop-esque backing vocals, which Dion and the Belmonts would have coveted. And she\xe2\x80\x99s on the verge of falling apart completely on \xe2\x80\x9cUnraveling,\xe2\x80\x9d a torchy slow-burner that Ford sings in a brawny falsetto over tremolo guitars and a subtle, muted horn section.' b'Though she rarely sounds at ease on Soul Sick, the blustery gusto with which Ford and her band tear through the songs turns her discomfort into catharsis. Even when her lyrics verge on self-pitying (\xe2\x80\x9cHurts So Bad,\xe2\x80\x9d say), Ford sounds like she is determined to exorcise her demons with a guitar and a tom-tom beat. Her energetic thrashing is infectious, like an open invitation to dance away your own pain. Loneliness may be power, but there\xe2\x80\x99s strength in numbers.'"
b'Animal Collective',6.1,b'The Painters EP',0,b'Experimental',b'February 17 2017',"b'After\xc2\xa02016\xe2\x80\x99s loopy\xc2\xa0Painting With, Animal Collective return with a companion EP.'","b'One way to think of a shape-shifting group like Animal Collective is that they\xe2\x80\x99re a different band with each album. Sometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s true in a literal sense, considering that Noah \xe2\x80\x9cPanda Bear\xe2\x80\x9d Lennox, David \xe2\x80\x9cAvey Tare\xe2\x80\x9d Portner, and Brian \xe2\x80\x9cGeologist\xe2\x80\x9d Weitz recorded without Josh \xe2\x80\x9cDeakin\xe2\x80\x9d Dibb on both 2009\xe2\x80\x99s luminously definitive Merriweather Post Pavilion\xc2\xa0and on last year\xe2\x80\x99s busily candy-coated Painting With. But one of the more intriguing observations from the Painting With\xc2\xa0press cycle was that Animal Collective had themselves toyed with switching band names, only to be dissuaded by practical concerns, like listeners being able to find their music.' b'It seems fitting that a previously suggested alternate name, the Painters, resurfaced during the demo process for Painting With. Like its predecessor, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Centipede Hz, the last record is dense and ornamented with samples, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also brightly colored, synthetic, and dizzyingly hyperactive. After each Animal Collective album, the group has typically issued a related follow-up EP, including career highlights like 2005\xe2\x80\x99s Prospect Hummer\xc2\xa0and 2009\xe2\x80\x99s Fall Be Kind. The companion to Painting With is the four-song The Painters EP, and the records share a sensibility.' b'For however much Animal Collective have changed between each album, a juxtaposition between campfire primitivism and electronic experimentation has remained a near-constant. Painting With seemed to ball that up like never before into skewed, breakneck-paced pop miniatures.\xc2\xa0Generally speaking, more recent Animal Collective\xc2\xa0songs bang you on the head, lyrically and sonically, in a way the band didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily get stuck in your head in the same way as a \xe2\x80\x9cMy Girls,\xe2\x80\x9d either.\xc2\xa0The Painters EP was mostly recorded around the same time as its companion album, and while it\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonably compelling elaboration on its predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s synth-splattering aesthetic, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to change anyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind about this version of the group\xe2\x80\x99s sound.' b'The opener and first single, \xe2\x80\x9cKinda Bonkers,\xe2\x80\x9d resembles \xe2\x80\x9cFloriDada,\xe2\x80\x9d its counterpart from the last album: Both songs overcome their playful if obvious titles; both find Panda Bear and Avey Tare trading vocals in such a way that they\xe2\x80\x99re almost finishing each other\xe2\x80\x99s sentences; and both convey a utopian faith in transcending human differences. \xe2\x80\x9cKinda Bonkers\xe2\x80\x9d distinguishes itself, though, partly because its odd burbles and tribal pulse are at a statelier tempo. And where \xe2\x80\x9cFloriDada\xe2\x80\x9d plays its vision of \xe2\x80\x9ca future/connected by sutures\xe2\x80\x9d into wry \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x99s the bridge\xe2\x80\x9d puns, \xe2\x80\x9cKinda Bonkers\xe2\x80\x9d resolves into a communal mantra: \xe2\x80\x9cUnity of all kind, unity of all kind.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The middle of the EP passes pleasantly but less arrestingly. \xe2\x80\x9cPeacemaker\xe2\x80\x9d is more relaxed than almost anything on Painting With, and here the vocal exchanges tend to happen at the level of syllables, not half-sentences. At high volume in headphones, it offers enough squiggly nuances to hold interest, underpinned by glassy synth and a lurching rhythmic base. On the bouncier \xe2\x80\x9cGoalkeeper,\xe2\x80\x9d what precisely is being sung about this soccer savior\xc2\xa0gets largely buried in thuds and squelches.' b'Painters\xe2\x80\x99 most notable inclusion is a cover of Martha & the Vandellas\xe2\x80\x99 mid-\xe2\x80\x9960s classic \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy Mack,\xe2\x80\x9d done the Painters\xe2\x80\x99 way: delirious, yawpy, and belching with synth. As anyone familiar with the original song might hope, it\xe2\x80\x99s ecstatic with\xc2\xa0yearning, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise Animal Collective made a habit of working this into their 2016 tour stops. But the song doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lend itself to their current manic style, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine choosing this take\xc2\xa0over the Vandellas\xe2\x80\x94or any other version.' b""If hearing Animal Collective do \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy Mack\xe2\x80\x9d tells us anything, it's that writing a great song, like painting a modern-day\xc2\xa0masterpiece, is difficult. Animal Collective have done it\xc2\xa0before, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll hopefully do it again. Odds are, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be a different band then, and, as a wide-eyed Painters EP\xc2\xa0narrator might point out, their listeners will be different,\xc2\xa0too."""
b'King Woman',8.2,b'Created in the Image of Suffering',0,b'Metal',b'February 17 2017',"b'On King Woman\xe2\x80\x99s debut LP, band mastermind Kristina Esfandiari finds her own path to redemption in doom\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to inspire new believers outside of metal circles.'","b'The response to Doubt stunned Kristina Esfandiari. In 2015, the San Francisco songwriter finally issued her proper, full-band debut as King Woman, a name she\xe2\x80\x99d toyed with for years while playing in other people\xe2\x80\x99s bands.\xc2\xa0Across the EP\xe2\x80\x99s four songs, Esfandiari used blown-out, country-kissed doom to reckon with and rage against a childhood spent in a Christian cult-like community.\xc2\xa0The unlikely mix\xe2\x80\x94where waves of distortion and wrecking-ball drums crashed against a voice that somehow drifted even as it raged\xe2\x80\x94found a sudden following. Conjuring Slowdive, Sleep, and maybe even Lucinda Williams, King Woman became one of the decade\xe2\x80\x99s most interesting new doom acts, loaded with crossover potential.' b'But Doubt courted a more unexpected audience, too\xe2\x80\x94the same religious clutches Esfandiari had castigated during those songs and in interviews with The Huffington Post\xc2\xa0and Rolling Stone. She soon started to clarify her positions publicly, but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t back down. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my experience. This is my story, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a fuck about what any you think,\xe2\x80\x9d she said last year. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had no voice for long enough, and there\xe2\x80\x99s so much that I need to say.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Esfandiari doesn\xe2\x80\x99t repent during Created in the Image of Suffering, King Woman\xe2\x80\x99s brazen and brilliant first LP, either. Instead, she redoubles her frustration and invective, not only impugning religious fervor but slyly subverting it as well, using its ecclesiastical language for very human conquests. Her writing is gripping and unapologetic, shrugging off the veils and cloaks of Doubt to address her grievances and express her regrets directly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish somebody would have told me/\xe2\x80\x99Cause the past you can\xe2\x80\x99t get back,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings as \xe2\x80\x9cWorn\xe2\x80\x9d lifts to its grand chorus, \xe2\x80\x9cFeels like somebody wore me/There\xe2\x80\x99s a deliverance I lack.\xe2\x80\x9d Backed by a three-piece that seems now to share ownership of these songs, she seems to be finding her own path to redemption in doom\xe2\x80\x94and, in doing so, created one of the young year\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful rock records to date.' b'No one gets off easy here. Esfandiari scorns the self-medicating faithful during \xe2\x80\x9cDeny,\xe2\x80\x9d her soft but haunting voice riding a riff that feels as sharp as a reaper\xe2\x80\x99s scythe. \xe2\x80\x9cShame,\xe2\x80\x9d meanwhile, spotlights the existential dread of Esfandiari\xe2\x80\x99s former fellow adherents. She wonders how they find comfort in doomsday prophecies and punitive proclamations, why they seek shelter in something that feels so vengeful. She worries less about\xc2\xa0what people worship than how they worship\xe2\x80\x94specifically, how they use their beliefs to ensnare themselves and those around them, herself included. During Doubt, King Woman seemed to be learning how to communicate these concerns as a group; here, they preach together as a mighty team. The band pounds away behind her questions and observations, the bellicose rhythm section and snarling guitars demanding answers from a society of self-delusion.' b""The real strength of this still-new quartet becomes clear on \xe2\x80\x9cHierophant,\xe2\x80\x9d the centerpiece of these eight songs. Esfandiari funnels the language of the sacred into a series of profane come-ons: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a holy church, I wanna worship,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a\xc2\xa0sacred script, I am the Hierophant.\xe2\x80\x9d She treats actual human lust with the same sort of obsessive, accidentally prurient language evangelicals sometimes use for God. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny, seductive, and coming from someone who has seen both sides, tragic. And with a chorus that hits like an electrified lullaby with a heretic\xe2\x80\x99s sense of mischief, it wouldn't be hard to imagine \xe2\x80\x9cHierophant\xe2\x80\x9d as a rock radio anthem. Now that would be a coveted fall from grace."" b'Religious reckoning, of course, is nothing new to metal. For decades, the genre has subsisted on turning crosses and crowns upside down, self-identifying with the damned, and lampooning sources of self-proclaimed deliverance. But Esfandiari\xe2\x80\x99s rebuke on Created in the Image of Suffering is personal and real in a way that vaguely recalls the torment of the Delta blues or the spiritual keening of early American gospel music. Darkness is not just some metaphorical tool for expressing defiance or disillusionment\xe2\x80\x94Esfandiari has suffered and survived the horrors of which she sings. And yet there is an empowered spirit at the core of Created in the Image of Suffering, an understanding that goodness and light can crawl out of that dark, even if it takes a lifetime. With King Woman, Esfandiari has staked out her own salvation, and\xc2\xa0Created in the Image of Suffering is strong enough to inspire a lot of new believers.'"
b'Young Marco',7.9,b'Selectors 002',0,b'Electronic',b'February 17 2017',b'Amsterdam DJ Young Marco Sterk mixes Buchla experiments with Nintendo-derived dance in his ambitious new mix.',"b'In just a few years, Amsterdam\xe2\x80\x99s Dekmantel label has grown from throwing dance parties for 200 of their closest friends into a powerhouse label and a stellar annual festival. They recently leapt continents to throw their first festival in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo and last year, they spun off another mini-festival, Dekmantel Selectors, staged on a coastal resort in Croatia. As the name suggests, the latter festival emphasizes DJs with an ear bent towards the obscure and unheard. For those who didn\xe2\x80\x99t snap up tickets, as accompaniment, the label released compilations of such curious tunes from their favorite DJs. The first release in the series featured Motor City Drum Ensemble\xe2\x80\x99s Danilo Plessow balancing transporter-beam house, loft disco rarities, and raucous gospel-funk.' b'For the second entry in the series, Amsterdam\xe2\x80\x99s Young Marco\xc2\xa0takes a decidedly different path. Marco\xe2\x80\x99s mix hunts for tracks from outcasts and outliers, suggesting a bizarro world of not-dance dance music. Across 10 tracks, he finds Buchla experiments and a track made entirely from the old Nintendo game Mario Paint, cringeworthy Eighties Dutch rap, and a dewy jazz-funk delicacy from the lone legendary name on the comp, Larry Heard.' b'Along the way, Marco pays plenty of cheeky tributes to his Dutch roots. In the wake of Sugarhill Gang\xe2\x80\x99s chart success in the Netherlands, Jolyon Grevelt earned the humble title of being the first Dutch rapper, making\xc2\xa0a record\xc2\xa0as Danny Boy at the age of 13 in 1980. So leave it to Marco to find an even weirder B-side from the lad with which to open Selectors 002. Its rubber band-lite funk gets intercut every few minutes by cat meows, wikki-wikki scratches, vocoder chants, and what Jared Leto\xe2\x80\x99s Joker sneezing might sound like run through an Echoplex. Yet somehow, it all adds up into something that just escapes being an unlistenable oddity.' b'While EBM became a worldwide force thanks to the likes of Front 242 and Ministry, Sterk finds late \xe2\x80\x9980\xe2\x80\x99s Dutch examples that are peculiar mutations of that relentless electronic sound. Gerrit Hoekema\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTelevisiewereld\xe2\x80\x9d sounds as whimsical as Aphex Twin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFingerbib,\xe2\x80\x9d with its circuitry curling up at the edges of the track. The Force Dimension\xe2\x80\x99s 1989 track \xe2\x80\x9c200 FA\xe2\x80\x9d trades the genre\xe2\x80\x99s distorted drum programming for what could be ethnographic tribal chants.' b'To Marco\xe2\x80\x99s ear, there\xe2\x80\x99s a connection to be made between the extremely rare and expensive Buchla Music Easel and a video game console. He digs up a 1981 track from Philly group Ghostwriters (an early duo featuring analog synth legend Charles Cohen) that deploys the Buchla on the joyous bubbling of \xe2\x80\x9cSwizzle\xe2\x80\x9d and then, a few tracks later, slots in Ray Tracing\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMariopaint,\xe2\x80\x9d an anthemic bit of digital tiddlywinks from the mid-\xe2\x80\x9890s. That entry comes from Irdial Disc\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar \xe2\x80\x9995 comp that had as its only piece of gear the Nintendo Super Famicom, running the Mario Paint music sequencer as its only bit of software. Neither selection would scream \xe2\x80\x9cpeak hour,\xe2\x80\x9d but in Marco\xe2\x80\x99s hands, his gifts as a \xe2\x80\x9cselector\xe2\x80\x9d become clear. Like a packet of Sea-Monkeys, Marco knows just when to sprinkle in seemingly un-danceable tracks so as to make them wiggle to life in just the right setting.'"
b'Meatbodies',6.3,b'Alice',0,b'Rock',b'February 17 2017',"b'Chad Ubovich is\xc2\xa0already a proven guitar hero, having played\xc2\xa0in Fuzz and with Mikal Cronin. His second Meatbodies album\xc2\xa0is a mellower, full-band effort with more psychedelic textures than before.'","b'As California garage rock was\xc2\xa0recently enjoying a hot streak of sorts, Meatbodies emerged with a 2014 debut\xc2\xa0that asserted them as wreckers to be reckoned with. Songs like \xe2\x80\x9cDisorder,\xe2\x80\x9d with its fast, beefy, infectious hook, could hang with Ty Segall\xe2\x80\x99s most rabid material. (It helps, of course, that Segall himself played bass and drums on that track.) It was an album with layers\xe2\x80\x94one where earworm hooks and massive guitar solos wove together with gradual, acoustic psychedelia. Frontman and Meatbodies mastermind Chad Ubovich was already a proven guitar hero from his tenure in Fuzz and Mikal Cronin\xe2\x80\x99s live band. With Meatbodies, he showed that he was an artist who could craft a strong rock album all on his own.' b'On Alice, Meatbodies test the limits of their capabilities by wading into murkier waters: they made a concept album. The overarching story isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly spelled out, but the album is filled with strange characters and over-the-top symbolism. Alice, from the title track, leaves men bloody and foaming on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cDisciples\xe2\x80\x9d is sung from the perspective of a king who declares himself \xe2\x80\x9cthe idol,\xe2\x80\x9d relishes the fealty of his apostles, and demands his subjects keep their feelings to themselves. Sisyphus, Bethlehem, martyrs, rolling stones, bombs, burning oceans, and translucent flesh are all ingredients in Alice\xe2\x80\x99s narrative slurry. Near Biblical images of torture come before concerns about whether or not to check your texts first thing in the morning. There\xe2\x80\x99s likely some allegory in there, but in the chaos, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult\xc2\xa0to parse what exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re going for.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s fine, though, since the lyrical fire and brimstone is\xc2\xa0a natural fit for Meatbodies\xe2\x80\x99 well-honed thrash. That said, the band behind Alice is a different beast than the one on\xc2\xa0Meatbodies. The debut album\xe2\x80\x99s massive sound fell largely on the shoulders of Ubovich, who played\xc2\xa0most of the instruments himself (with an assist from Segall). Alice is a proper full-band effort. While Ubovich still plays multiple instruments, and his guitar solos take a good share of the spotlight (especially the monster that opens \xe2\x80\x9cDisciples\xe2\x80\x9d), drummer Erik Jimenez keeps things frantic. Bassist Kevin Boog is responsible for the band\xe2\x80\x99s monolithic low end this time. The biggest wrinkle in the band\xe2\x80\x99s makeup comes with the addition of Patrick Nolan (of\xc2\xa0Walter), who trades lead vocal duties with Ubovich throughout.\xc2\xa0More\xc2\xa0voices means more\xc2\xa0variety, and the full band pack even more\xc2\xa0psychedelic textural experimentation than before.' b'While there are a few livewire moments that recall Meatbodies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0most exciting work\xe2\x80\x94the triumphant riff from \xe2\x80\x9cTouchless,\xe2\x80\x9d for example\xe2\x80\x94*Alice *doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly come out swinging. It\xe2\x80\x99s a more sedate record; mellow grooves and acoustic strumming make up its core infrastructure. On \xe2\x80\x9cKings,\xe2\x80\x9d big, fuzzy guitar solos are largely just\xc2\xa0dressing\xe2\x80\x94they sit alongside the synths, adding atmosphere instead of maintaining focus. \xe2\x80\x9cGyre\xe2\x80\x9d is caked in fuzz and leads with a high drama guitar solo, but the song\xe2\x80\x99s seven-minute runtime drags as the melody and instruments thin out. Several songs go on for\xc2\xa0a little too long, and the added guitar fireworks\xc2\xa0rarely overcome the repetitive, less interesting melodies. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a standout hook that\xe2\x80\x99s as\xc2\xa0immediate or exciting as 2014 tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cHim,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cMountain,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cDisorder.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately the trouble with Meatbodies\xe2\x80\x99 concept record ambitions. A muddled narrative isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big deal, but with\xc2\xa0Alice, Meatbodies have snuffed out a little too much of their old fire.'"

Danny Brown]',6.9,b'Accelerator',0,b'Rap',b'February 16 2017',"b'Following their collaboration on\xc2\xa0last year\xe2\x80\x99s Atrocity Exhibition, the Accelerator 12\xe2\x80\x9d finds Danny Brown and producer Paul White coloring even more brazenly outside of hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s lines.'","b'Speaking to an audience in Glasgow during a Red Bull Music Academy lecture in 2015, Danny Brown attempted to describe Atrocity Exhibition, his then forthcoming album. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to push myself as far and make rap as progressive as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown explained. \xe2\x80\x9cSo maybe like, I\xe2\x80\x99m on some Trent Reznor shit with this one, you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying?\xe2\x80\x9d Atrocity Exhibition\xc2\xa0made good on this, employing lumbering post-punk rhythms, industrial textures, and obscure musique concr\xc3\xa8te samples in service of Brown\xe2\x80\x99s dystopic vision. Of course, Brown didn\xe2\x80\x99t work alone; the English beatmaker Paul White produced the bulk of the album. The pair\xc2\xa0have a long history of pushing boundaries together. White has contributed to every Brown album since 2011\xe2\x80\x99s XXX**, and with Atrocity Exhibition, it felt like they had finally managed to tear down whatever barriers remained between hip-hop and their wide-ranging influences.' b'A victory lap of sorts, the\xc2\xa0Accelerator\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9d feels even more uncompromising. Take the title track, wherein White pummels the listener with disorderly polyrhythms and driving intensity. Included here in the barrage of sounds are a tangle of bongos that clop like hooves at a horse track; a buzzing, prog-rock guitar run; a rolling, rubberband bassline; and a psychedelic, reverb-soaked guitar solo. If that sounds like an emcee\xe2\x80\x99s worst nightmare, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it from Brown\xe2\x80\x99s nimble rapping. He manages to effortlessly surf the track\xe2\x80\x99s competing drum lines. \xe2\x80\x9cRappers rap about it/But never really live it/I never glorify it/I tell it how it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he yelps in his signature squeaky register, neatly summing up his documentarian appeal. Of course, Brown\xc2\xa0can\xe2\x80\x99t help but see the sonic chaos around him as a metaphor for a mind\xc2\xa0on drugs, half-singing, \xe2\x80\x9cWalking light\xc2\xa0the ground is so shaky/Losing sight, \xe2\x80\x99cause things is so hazy.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The song\xe2\x80\x99s video features a man chasing his escaped, anthropomorphic brain through the streets of London, which feels about right.' b'The B-side, \xe2\x80\x9cLion\xe2\x80\x99s Den,\xe2\x80\x9d takes a slightly different tack\xe2\x80\x94while it\xe2\x80\x99s plenty unorthodox, it slows things down to an even keel. The song is built around a loop of a y\xc3\xa9-y\xc3\xa9 singer set atop a plaintive pan flute melody; instead of a hi-hat, the steady boom-bap beat lands on a tambourine hit. Brown knows a thing or two about juxtaposition and here he delivers on the promise he makes in \xe2\x80\x9cAccelerator,\xe2\x80\x9d weaving a tale of street life and addiction that\xe2\x80\x99s anything but glamorous. Brown details days spent hustling \xe2\x80\x9cjust to get up out the gutter,\xe2\x80\x9d admits to \xe2\x80\x9cserving out our momma\xe2\x80\x99s house\xe2\x80\x9d and finally concedes, \xe2\x80\x9cthe pain never ends.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, the song\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate message is one of defiance in the face of hopelessness: \xe2\x80\x9cWe gotta break the cycle, a future for our kids/You see it half empty, I\xc2\xa0see it half full.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'White\xe2\x80\x99s audaciousness\xc2\xa0on Accelerator is commendable, though the single suffers a bit for its maximalism. As bold as Atrocity Exhibition was, it also felt refined, with\xc2\xa0the record\xe2\x80\x99s sharpest edges counterbalanced by moments of restraint. Accelerator throws that moderation out the window, resulting in two songs that feel unnecessarily cluttered; in particular, the vocal loop that runs throughout \xe2\x80\x9cLion\xe2\x80\x99s Den\xe2\x80\x9d distracts from Brown\xe2\x80\x99s rapping, holding back what\xe2\x80\x99s very nearly a great song. That said, both of these tracks do seem to be abrasive by design\xe2\x80\x94like White is intentionally pitching curveballs at Brown, just to see if he can hit them. To that end,\xc2\xa0Accelerator\xc2\xa0also feels like a dare to any other emcees\xc2\xa0who think they could\xc2\xa0tackle these beats. It seems unlikely that very many will try.'"
b'Maggie Rogers',6.5,b'Now That the Light Is Fading',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'February 16 2017',"b'Following the viral success of her Pharrell-approved hit \xe2\x80\x9cAlaska,\xe2\x80\x9d this young singer-songwriter searches for an original sound on her major label debut EP.'","b'Maggie Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cAlaska\xe2\x80\x9d was born with the kind of serendipitous discovery story entire TV series are commissioned to replicate. She was one of many students\xc2\xa0at New York University\xe2\x80\x99s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, a school with enough largesse to commission Pharrell Williams for a masterclass. That half-hour listening session made it to YouTube in its entirety, but the highlight was obvious. Eighteen minutes in, when Rogers played an early demo of her song \xe2\x80\x9cAlaska,\xe2\x80\x9d a star was born: Rogers, in a casual sweater and jeans, eyes averted, wincing in that way one does when hearing their own voice; Pharrell, moved to tears, invoking Stevie Wonder and the Wu-Tang Clan in his praise. The video went viral on the musical enclaves of Reddit, always ready to laud anything that sounds acoustic or authentic, and thus followed everything virality brings: getting signed, a headlining North American tour, the interview circuit, and\xc2\xa0hundreds of thousands of fans from the get go.' b'Like most famous discovery stories, though, this one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite start at the beginning. Though she\xe2\x80\x99s since been f\xc3\xaated around as an entirely new voice, Rogers has four releases on Bandcamp dating back to 2012. Recorded in high school, they show great promise in a specific genre: banjo- and ukelele-driven folk indebted to Joni Mitchell and Patti Smith. There are hints at Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 current\xc2\xa0expanded direction on these early tracks, in the cirrus flicks of synths on \xe2\x80\x9cDrift\xe2\x80\x9d off 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Blood Ballet, the cello-enhanced \xe2\x80\x9cSatellite,\xe2\x80\x9d or the entirety of The Response, a remix album of 2012\xe2\x80\x99s The Echo*\xc2\xa0*that proves Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 music is amenable, at least in theory, to dance. But for the most part the Bandcamp material provides\xc2\xa0thoughtful examples of a genre that\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneously thriving and, unless your surname is Mumford, deeply, deeply unmarketable.' b'Rogers credits her new, synthier direction on \xe2\x80\x9cAlaska\xe2\x80\x9d and subsequent five-song EP Now That the Light Is Fading to a year of clubbing in Europe, but an equally apt explanation may involve facts of the marketplace. Pharrell said \xe2\x80\x9cAlaska\xe2\x80\x9d was like nothing he\xe2\x80\x99d ever heard, but in 2017 it fits right in: a gently lilting beat that vaguely evokes tropicalia (or, for that matter, the Neptunes in their prime) along with a falsetto pre-chorus that vaguely evokes R&B. The result isn\xe2\x80\x99t far off from Broods, or early Ellie Goulding, or, to go back to the last time folktronica blew everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds, early Beth Orton. Follow-up single \xe2\x80\x9cDog Years,\xe2\x80\x9d dotted with pan flutes, comes across as the exact midpoint of Peter Gabriel, Lorde, and \xe2\x80\x9cBleeding Love,\xe2\x80\x9d and while no one\xe2\x80\x99s done that particular intersection lately, the industry\xe2\x80\x99s certainly revived everything in the vicinity.' b'Perhaps this is why *Now That the Light Is Fading *feels transitional, as if Rogers is unsure how far from trad-folk she wants to stray. On one end of the spectrum is \xe2\x80\x9cColor Song,\xe2\x80\x9d which consists of bird chirps, Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 multitracked choral vocals, and not much else. The track\xe2\x80\x99s melody drifts up and down the scale like an old hymn or trad-Americana cut\xc2\xa0as the lyric lingers on certain evocative details (when she sings the word \xe2\x80\x9ccreeping,\xe2\x80\x9d her vocals are tracked a split second off one another, letting the consonants crackle in the air), and nothing anywhere suggests Pharrell\xe2\x80\x99s involvement, spiritual or otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cOn +\xc2\xa0Off\xe2\x80\x9d floats Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 voice above a choppy, Flume-like backing track and insistent piano loop, and \xe2\x80\x9cBetter\xe2\x80\x9d lets her sink amid a drone; both directions are promising, but in separate ways that don\xe2\x80\x99t quite cohere. Rogers is a promising songwriter when unattended\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cAlaska\xe2\x80\x9d in particular is full of understated heartbreak, sort of like a PG take on Tori Amos\xe2\x80\x94but the poppier tracks here often dissolve into soft-rock nothingness.' b'A lot of this might resolve itself in time. Rogers is still very young at 22, after all, and she takes several game attempts at subtlety throughout the EP\xe2\x80\x94the pan flute, the guitar line rippling through \xe2\x80\x9cOn + Off\xe2\x80\x9d like wind chimes, the featherlight harmonies. She has a platform. She\xe2\x80\x99s got ideas. But like all discovery stories, the real reward lies in what comes next.'"
b'Craig Taborn',8.2,b'Daylight Ghosts',0,b'Experimental',b'February 16 2017',"b'Jazz piano shredder Craig Taborn is a compositional force on his new quartet album. From the LP\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0grand design to its smallest quirks, Taborn and his bandmates\xc2\xa0make the music\xc2\xa0gently rage.'","b'If invitations to jam can give any hint of a musician\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, then Craig Taborn has to be one of the most admired jazz pianists in the world. He\xe2\x80\x99s released a handful of\xc2\xa0albums under his own name, beginning with a hard-to-find 1994 debut on the DIW label. But Taborn has been featured in a sideman role on a stunning array of sessions. Of late, he has delivered vigorous free-improv work alongside Art Ensemble of Chicago co-founder Roscoe Mitchell. And he has also played some of John Zorn\xe2\x80\x99s most lyrical pieces in a trio that included the fiercely swinging bassist Christian McBride.' b'Central to Taborn\xe2\x80\x99s wide appeal is the way he can thread \xe2\x80\x9cfree jazz\xe2\x80\x9d style playing inside more conventional structures. A knowledge of funk and electronic music informs his ability to create catchy, short vamps, in the midst of otherwise frenetic solos. In his original compositions, Taborn\xe2\x80\x99s playing has an exquisite rightness\xe2\x80\x94even during the most out-there passages. If he starts playing motifs in different meters, in each hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because he\xe2\x80\x99s in a particular hurry to show off his chops. When a rush of tricky rhythm hits, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the tune has been building toward that density. The fact that Taborn can shift into this experimental high gear so casually helps keep his music feeling poised and approachable.' b'Since signing to ECM earlier this decade, Taborn\xe2\x80\x99s output as a leader has ticked up in pace a bit. A 2011 solo piano album, both impressionistic and intense in character, served as his label debut. A trio record of subtle heat followed in 2013. The peaks of bash that Taborn produces elsewhere were mostly absent on those outings. (It\xe2\x80\x99s not a complete surprise, given ECM\xe2\x80\x99s focus on serene aesthetics.) The trend continues on Taborn\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0new quartet album, Daylight Ghosts, but on this occasion, he\xc2\xa0sets a quixotic challenge for himself. The pianist and his bandmates find ways to make the music sound raging despite the moderate dynamic levels.' b'Opening track \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shining One\xe2\x80\x9d creates drama through jagged switches. To start, drummer Dave King\xe2\x80\x94most famous for his work in the Bad Plus\xe2\x80\x94teases listeners with a brief solo groove. Then he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, leaving Taborn and tenor saxophonist Chris Speed to voice the piece\xe2\x80\x99s winding, long-lined theme together. When the rhythm section comes back in, the beat is free. Taborn dives with precision over the keyboard during his solo, while Speed rephrases portions of the main hook, rooting the performance.' b'The contrasts here\xe2\x80\x94between fixed and free rhythms, between melody and cacophony\xe2\x80\x94are wild. Still, the group\xe2\x80\x99s collective touch remains gentle, sublime. As they eventually converge on a beat that recalls King\xe2\x80\x99s opening, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that the music is fulfilling an inevitable destiny. This all happens in three and a half minutes: an economy of duration that is rare in exploratory modern jazz.' b'Nothing else on Daylight Ghosts repeats this pattern, though several other tracks manage to be equally surprising. On \xe2\x80\x9cAncient,\xe2\x80\x9d an introductory solo from bassist Chris Lightcap has a solemn spirituality. The rest of the ensemble enters gingerly\xe2\x80\x94yet by the end of the tune, they\xe2\x80\x99re all engaged in an ecstatic group dance. The title track\xe2\x80\x99s initial chorus and solos sound bummed out beyond belief; soon, the cloistered vibe gives way to a minimalist theme that suggests rising spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cAbandoned Reminder\xe2\x80\x9d is driven by noir sonics\xc2\xa0before a Taborn riff puts the tempo into urgent overdrive. On \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Silence,\xe2\x80\x9d Speed switches to clarinet\xe2\x80\x94and\xc2\xa0Taborn\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0arrangement responds to the reed player\xe2\x80\x99s lustrous tone with an electronic percussion part.' b'In between those unpredictable statements, Taborn provides a few palette-cleansers that are more direct. \xe2\x80\x9cJamaican Farewell,\xe2\x80\x9d his cover of a Roscoe Mitchell ballad, is handled gorgeously, as the bandleader oversees a slight electronic sheen. And \xe2\x80\x9cNew Glory\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shroud its intentions at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s simply an uptempo shot of Taborn\xe2\x80\x99s gift for joyous, funk-inspired riffing\xe2\x80\x94as well as a look at his ability to ornament a catchy melody for as long as he wants.' b'The final cut, \xe2\x80\x9cPhantom Ratio,\xe2\x80\x9d is a fitting capstone for an album with this much range. The lengthy track features droning tones that would fit in well in a concert of contemporary-classical chamber music, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also driven by an electronic keyboard loop. This is the\xc2\xa0sort of fractured, almost-danceable motif that Taborn has occasionally toyed with since his influential 2004 fusion album Junk Magic. Here, the stylistic distance from vintage IDM trends is greater. A brief electronic percussion pulse rounds out the performance\xe2\x80\x94and the album\xe2\x80\x94much as a brief hit of King\xe2\x80\x99s acoustic drumming started things off. From its grand design down to its smallest quirks, Daylight Ghosts shows that Taborn is much more than an elite jazz piano shredder. He\xe2\x80\x99s a compositional force, as well.'"
b'Lowly',7.8,b'Heba',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'February 16 2017',"b'On their full-length\xc2\xa0debut, the Danish dream pop group\xc2\xa0take a quantum leap forward, with a richer and more eclectic sound.'","b'When Lowly first appeared with a string of singles in 2014, the Danish five-piece\xe2\x80\x99s proficiency with atmospheres was clear. Those singles, along with an EP the following year, showcased the band\xe2\x80\x99s affinity for soaking its songs in heavy reverb. Naturally, Lowly\xe2\x80\x99s music hearkened back to previous generations of dream pop, shoegaze, and even the Beach Boys recording vocals in a swimming pool. But atmosphere alone isn\xe2\x80\x99t much more effective than aiming a video camera at a hunk of dry ice, and Lowly\xe2\x80\x94like countless bands who aim for a similar feel\xe2\x80\x94appeared to approach music from the outside in, as if tones and pedals could substitute for drama.' b'On Heba, Lowly\xe2\x80\x99s debut LP, the band takes a quantum leap forward. Opener\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cStill Life\xe2\x80\x9d taps into universal feelings of sadness and isolation with such power it would be unbearable if the music supporting it weren\xe2\x80\x99t so beautiful. \xe2\x80\x9cStill Life\xe2\x80\x9d captures that moment when one becomes aware that a relationship is doomed.\xc2\xa0Guitarist/vocalist Nanna Schannong and sampler/vocalist Soffie Viemose sing together, as\xc2\xa0keyboardist Kasper Staub\xe2\x80\x99s synths sweep across the music like gusts of remorse.\xc2\xa0Viemose and Schannong convey a sense of repetition over multiple lifetimes when they sing, \xe2\x80\x9cThe memories distort before I can tell/For centuries they\xe2\x80\x99ve been fading/Over and over again.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, drummer Steffen Lundtoft\xe2\x80\x94who manages to play with both a jazz player\xe2\x80\x99s taste for active patterns and a pop musician\xe2\x80\x99s instinct for economy\xe2\x80\x94drags the beat back to a crawl, as if to frame the glacial pace\xc2\xa0of the lyrics.' b'Lowly\xe2\x80\x99s previous work hovered in a state of somber, slightly edgy, but otherwise unremarkable introspection. The music on Heba is exponentially more rich. And unlike, say, Mazzy Star, Lowly don\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0dwell in the languid cadence of the first song. \xe2\x80\x9cDeer Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0might have qualified as techno if Lundtoft hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, in a sense,\xc2\xa0reverse-engineered an electronic beat for his live kit. Even if they had opted for a programmed\xc2\xa0beat, the song\xe2\x80\x99s tempo layering and synths, along with bassist Thomas Lund\xe2\x80\x99s Moog work, make it all difficult to classify.' b'At times, \xe2\x80\x9cDeer Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Radiohead\xe2\x80\x99s Kid A-era forays into a form of music that is neither organic nor synthetic, but some combination thereof. At one point, the music clears away as Staub plays a synth line that evokes a warped, somewhat cartoonish string section;\xc2\xa0Staub drops the line in just once, a deft move that gives the song a fleeting touch of vintage records where pop chanteuses are backed by an orchestra.' b'The band varies its approach on pretty much every song after that. When Schannong sings lead on the funkier \xe2\x80\x9cLook at the Sun,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0her\xc2\xa0cutting voice injects a dose of Morcheeba-esque electro-R&B into the mix. And even though most of the lyrics only vaguely illustrate their subject matter, they shift in texture enough to magnify the stylistic changes from song to song. Named after a friend of the band who emigrated to Denmark from Syria, Heba doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly reference the real-life Heba\xe2\x80\x99s experience. Without that\xc2\xa0context, you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to spot a\xc2\xa0correlation, although\xc2\xa0several of the songs could be interpreted to fit a refugee or immigrant\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever felt so lonely/That you could map it on your body?\xe2\x80\x9d Viemose sings. The answer for all of us is \xe2\x80\x9cof course.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet Lowly have found a way to ask the question so that it sounds fresh every time, much like this album as a whole.'"

In terms of its sound, at least, it's a winner.""","b'Ryan Adams\xc2\xa0gravely misread the pop culture climate of 2015 and his\xc2\xa0fan letter\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0Taylor Swift\xc2\xa0was incinerated on arrival by the hot takes. But at least\xc2\xa01989\xc2\xa0was a reminder of a time when he was generating reactions that ran deeper than a respect for craft. For most of the past decade, Adams has made albums of almost oppressive competence: whether the songs from\xc2\xa0Ashes & Fire and\xc2\xa0Ryan Adams took five minutes or five years of soul-searching to create, they all come out sounding equally effortless. Purely in terms of its content, Adams\xe2\x80\x99 new album,\xc2\xa0Prisoner, is more of the same, and how that sits will depend on whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the singles or read the press clippings. It\xe2\x80\x99s another down-the-middle, crowd-pleasing Ryan Adams record\xc2\xa0at a time when that crowd was expecting him to bring the heat.' b'Still, as latter-day Ryan Adams albums go, there\xe2\x80\x99s more buzz than usual around\xc2\xa0Prisoner, and rightfully so. The neural blasts of guitar misfiring all over \xe2\x80\x9cDo You Still Love Me?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDoomsday\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s pink-mist shimmer outline a convergence point where the heartland comfort food of\xc2\xa0Ryan Adams, the puckish punk whims of\xc2\xa01984, and the arena-rock aspirations of\xc2\xa01989\xc2\xa0meet. Purely as sound,\xc2\xa0Prisoner\xc2\xa0unquestionably succeeds; though Reagan-era AOR is basically a primary color of modern pop at this point, Adams\xe2\x80\x99 vocals and lyrical tics are so well established that any genre bends to his will.\xc2\xa0If the title track and \xe2\x80\x9cAnything I Say to You Now\xe2\x80\x9d aren\xe2\x80\x99t career highlights, they\xe2\x80\x99re at least ambitions fully realized\xe2\x80\x94quintessential 2010s Ryan Adams, conveying a mis-remembered \xe2\x80\x9980s where\xc2\xa0Tunnel of Love\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0The Queen Is Dead\xc2\xa0are close neighbors on record shelves and equally revered documents of idealized longing.' b'Previews of\xc2\xa0Prisoner\xc2\xa0have not been shy about stating the obvious:\xc2\xa0this is Adams\xe2\x80\x99 first album since separating from actress Mandy Moore, which he described as a\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9chumiliating and just a fucking horrible\xc2\xa0thing to go through.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The context of the breakup is so central to how the album is being heard, news of the event might as well be slapped on a sticker on the cover.

b'Hand Habits',7.6,b'Wildly Idle (Humble Before the Void)',0,b'Rock',b'February 15 2017',"b'The debut album by Hand Habits\xe2\x80\x94aka Albany D.I.Y. stalwart Meg Duffy\xe2\x80\x94is a joyous, open-ended study in vulnerability.'","b'Hand Habits\xe2\x80\x99 debut LP, *Wildly Idle (Humble Before the Void), *evokes a striking image, that of submitting oneself to an expansive unknown with arms outstretched. It\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling Meg Duffy, the singer-songwriter behind this project, knows well; the upstate New York native once packed up everything and moved to Los Angeles to become the guitarist for Kevin Morby. Before that, she\xe2\x80\x99d experimented as Hand Habits around the Albany D.I.Y. scene and, in 2014, released Small Shifts, a 10-inch split with Avi Buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s Sheridan Riley.' b'It is with an earthly reverence that Duffy attends to her music. When Duffy plays with Morby, she\xe2\x80\x99s a calm and grounded presence, shredding with natural ease, often with eyes closed. Here, her meditations are never rushed and the record rumbles along patiently. Duffy recorded Wildly Idle herself between the Catskills and Los Angeles with assistance from Riley, Quilt\xe2\x80\x99s Keven Lareau, and M. Geddes Gengras. Rather than feeling pigeonholed by the sonic stereotypes of either locale (woodsy vs. hi-fi), *Wildly Idle *sounds birthed from exploration and experimentation.' b'Like her main influences, Grouper and Phil Elverum, Duffy understands that songs are \xe2\x80\x9cevolving, living things,\xe2\x80\x9d as the latter musician once said. One gets the sense that Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s songs are so thoroughly composed that they could fly off on their own. \xe2\x80\x9cActress\xe2\x80\x9d is overflowing with minutiae like the shaking of maracas, gentle guitars, and a moment when all these fizz into dissolution. \xe2\x80\x9cNow isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just like me?/I\xe2\x80\x99m cracking up out of the blue,\xe2\x80\x9d she asks after this break, with a hint of levity. Indeed, on *Wildly Idle, *Duffy displays a joy in opening herself up. Part of submission is admitting one\xe2\x80\x99s own vulnerability and reliance on the intangible, which Duffy does many times here. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want no one else/It\xe2\x80\x99s better to believe in something/Bigger than ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings on opener \xe2\x80\x9cFlower Glass.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Three poems (\xe2\x80\x9cscenes,\xe2\x80\x9d per Duffy), are scattered throughout the record and are read by their authors: Kayla Ephros, Catherine Pond, and Lucy Blagg. Beneath their distorted voices, Duffy warps her instruments into haunting, ethereal atmospheres. Each poem purposefully addresses one of the motifs Duffy confronts on Wildly Idle: \xe2\x80\x9cGreater LA\xe2\x80\x9d probes the metropolis\xe2\x80\x99 inherent despair, \xe2\x80\x9cCowboy\xe2\x80\x9d subverts gender roles, and \xe2\x80\x9cTime Hole\xe2\x80\x9d questions the rapid pace of contemporary life. Like Jenny Hval\xe2\x80\x99s collaborations with writer Annie Bielski, these additions work to minimize the distinction between poetry and song.' b'Listening to *Wildly Idle (Humble Before the Void) *reminds me of a line from Eve Babitz\xe2\x80\x99s collection Slow Days, Fast Company: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in love with people and ideas in several cities and learned that the lovers I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved and the ideas I\xe2\x80\x99ve embraced depended on where I was, how cold it was, and what I had to do to be able to stand it.\xe2\x80\x9d Duffy sings of romances come and gone without ever sounding jaded or spiteful; future love promises a mystery, a sensuality that\xe2\x80\x99s open like the road. \xe2\x80\x9cI just wanna be a bad boy/Baby in your arms tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d she murmurs at one point, with an Elvis-like softness. There\xe2\x80\x99s a hope here that the unknown contains more positivities than anxieties. The final words on the album are \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna grow,\xe2\x80\x9d and there\xe2\x80\x99s every reason to believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a promise Duffy will keep.'"
b'Quelle Chris',7.6,"b'Being You Is Great, I Wish I Could Be You More Often'",0,b'Rap',b'February 15 2017',"b'Prolific Detroit rapper-producer Quelle Chris offers up his most compelling bout of\xc2\xa0existential voyaging to date, ultimately catching more than just his own reflection in the mirror.'","b""Catharsis has been such an effective coping mechanism lately that it can be easy to forget what you really need sometimes is a strong sense of meditative focus. Before you can ramp yourself up enough to go out there and Get Shit Done, you need to believe that you're the kind of person who actually can and that it matters if you do in the first place. If you cultivate your chill well enough, you'll be able to bust through barriers and push off antagonists with a sly deadpan and your energy still preserved."" b""That's been the recent vibe given off by prolific Detroit MC/producer Quelle Chris, a low-key incisive weed-and-brew wiseass whose halting flow deliberates like the underground's rejoinder to mumble rap. Innocent Country, from 2015, was the album that hinted at deeper existential crises beneath the veneer of comedic bravado, a curious interrogation of his surroundings on both a personal and a wide-picture scale. Last year's Lullabies for the Broken Brain\xc2\xa0highlighted that same sense of walls-closing-in restlessness with a string of bass-rich but sandpapery instrumentals that communicated an insomniac anxiety through kick drums. Being You Is Great, I Wish I Could Be You More Often is the logical progression from both: a bout of existential voyaging that can't help but catch more than just Quelle's own reflection in the mirror."" b""Single \xe2\x80\x9cBuddies\xe2\x80\x9d is probably the pull-quote track of the album, an ego trip statement delivered with a calmly bemused, beatifically sincere voice: \xe2\x80\x9cI fuck with myself/I fucks with myself/Might bring myself some flowers/I'm in love with myself.\xe2\x80\x9d After that hook winds up resurfacing as a reprise once most of the record's portrait has been assembled, it's a bit easier to recognize as the problem he hints at: what is there, really, to love about himself, and does he even fuck with anyone else he knows? So he questions his own intelligence along with everyone else's (\xe2\x80\x9cDumb for Brains\xe2\x80\x9d), bites \xe2\x80\x9cthe bullet, the case, and the trigger\xe2\x80\x9d en route to finding some measure of perseverance (\xe2\x80\x9cPopeye\xe2\x80\x9d), takes on a crew's worth of voices as he both champions and shoots down a rap-game-focused end run around a dead-end living (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Dreamer in the Den of Wolves\xe2\x80\x9d), and generally tries to reconcile the bad stuff with the side of himself that\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of celebrating."" b""Quelle's heaviness isn't a burden, though. His flow is immersed in a conversational ease, somewhere between classic Madlib and a Hannibal Buress routine, his inflections coming across like emotive gestures\xe2\x80\x94shrugged shoulders, rolled eyes, rubbed temples. He's expressive enough to excuse lines flatter or cornier than the ones he actually brings, but mostly his cadence adds resonance to simple sentiments. When he admits, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I like to drink/Yes, I like to smoke/Yes it's an escape/I don't like to cope\xe2\x80\x9d over a pitched-up quasi-Quasimoto overdub on \xe2\x80\x9cLearn to Love Hate,\xe2\x80\x9d or takes a breather to rattle off a distilled barrage of pure-lyricist punchline shit-talk on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prestige,\xe2\x80\x9d Chris adapts to those shifts in tone and intensity with an almost disorienting ease."" b""He\xe2\x80\x99s got some strong hands on deck for guest spots, too. There are characteristically quotable verses by Roc Marciano, Elzhi, Homeboy Sandman, Jean Grae, and other frequent cohorts, as well as beats by producers ranging from MNDSGN (woozily harmony-driven on \xe2\x80\x9cPopeye\xe2\x80\x9d) to Alchemist (looping psych-folk wails on \xe2\x80\x9cPendulum Swing\xe2\x80\x9d) to Chris Keys (ruminative on three wildly different cuts). But for all the friends around him, Quelle\xe2\x80\x99s personality\xe2\x80\x94fractured as it is\xe2\x80\x94manifests clearly through his own particular quirks. Whether it's a self-produced beat that kicks up dust particles (like the snare-melting trudge of \xe2\x80\x9cFascinating Grass\xe2\x80\x9d) or his tendency to put on a voice that threatens to push you away before luring you back in, Quelle's whole approach is a self-examination that cuts both ways. Once you get that whole value-of-the-self situation figured out, Being You Is Great, I Wish I Could Be You More Often bumps enough to pace a purposeful movement out into the streets."""
b'Mind Over Mirrors',6.8,b'Undying Color',0,b'Experimental',b'February 15 2017',b'A solo artist gathers some pals for a trippy trip through the droney side of the avant-garde. Good for island meditations and pretending to be weightless.',"b'A project begun on an island in Washington State, Mind Over Mirrors springs from the imagination of Jaime Fennelly, who now resides in Chicago. Across five limited edition releases, Fennelly has performed alone. And while Undying Color, his sixth album (and first for Paradise of Bachelors) also began as a solo excursion (this time with Fennelly decamping to southwestern Wisconsin), he then went back into the studio with a full-fledged ensemble, including members from Eleventh Dream Day, Califone, Circuit des Yeux and Jon Mueller of Death Blues, to add more color to his drones and drifts.' b'But while Mind Over Mirrors now sounds like a live group, their influences don\xe2\x80\x99t reference bands per se as much as they do iconoclastic American composers of the 20th century. Mirrors\xe2\x80\x99 bio references G.I. Gurdjieff\xe2\x80\x99s esoteric harmonium music, but almost every piece on Undying Color hearkens back to the likes of Terry Riley, Harry Partch, Laurie Spiegel and Henry Flynt, to name a few. And at the center of it all remains Fennelly\xe2\x80\x99s hard-pumping harmonium. His drone hovers over opener \xe2\x80\x9cRestore & Slip,\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s most energetic number. It then swiftly scales up thanks to a tumbling drum kit beat and some furious fiddling that evokes the sawing fury of Henry Flynt and his penchant for hillbilly minimalism. Together it all builds to an ecstatic and buzzing peak that the album is hard-pressed to replicate for the remainder of the album.' b'While Fennelly\xe2\x80\x99s Indian pedal harmonium has always been the centerpiece of Mind Over Mirrors, with Undying Color he adds in an Oberheim synth and shows a wider range and malleability. On \xe2\x80\x9cGray Clearer,\xe2\x80\x9d he has a tone that wheezes and expands like Pauline Oliveros\xe2\x80\x99s bandoneon against a shuffling, shamanic thump. For \xe2\x80\x9cSplintering,\xe2\x80\x9d Fennelly mimics the antigravity properties of Laurie Spiegel\xe2\x80\x99s analog components, floating free alongside rubbed singing bowls and a wordless vocal from Eleventh Dream Day and Freakwater member Janet Beveridge Bean. His harmonium swirls and slowly accrues a thick shoegaze fuzz on the flickering \xe2\x80\x9c600 Miles Around.\xe2\x80\x9d And on \xe2\x80\x9cGlossolaliac,\xe2\x80\x9d Fennelly\xe2\x80\x99s keys churn and cycle like one of Terry Riley\xe2\x80\x99s vintage all-night flights, soon synching with violin and Haley Fohr\xe2\x80\x99s voice. It\xe2\x80\x99s the clear album highlight, a cosmic trip that condenses such expansive minimalist explorations into a delectably concise three-minute length.' b'Inversely, where the album stumbles is on the lengthy 12-minute song, \xe2\x80\x9cGravity Wake.\xe2\x80\x9d The Oberheim yawns and crests, a steady snare pattern giving the piece its processional rhythm. Bean and Fohr\xe2\x80\x99s voices entwine in murmurs about space and Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of general relativity, Fohr\xe2\x80\x99s more dramatic voice giving gravitas to the command: \xe2\x80\x9cBe the gravity wake.\xe2\x80\x9d Tasteful and restrained as Fennelly\xe2\x80\x99s playing is, here it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have quite enough energy or movement to sustain such a runtime. That said, the expanded palette and membership bodes well for future explorations.'"
b'Lupe Fiasco',7.4,b'DROGAS Light',0,b'Rap',b'February 14 2017',"b'By embracing the detuned bass and dope boy cool of state-of-the-art trap, Lupe Fiasco delivers his most subversive album\xc2\xa0yet.'","b'Lupe Fiasco\xe2\x80\x99s new album introduces itself with a shocking display of force: \xe2\x80\x9cDopamine Lit (Intro)\xe2\x80\x9d is two minutes and 49 seconds of foghorn bass, fiery bars, and a half-joking, half-drunken chorus that includes a Billboard flip-off, a Lord of the Rings reference, and some self-consciously nonsensical trap grunts, for good measure. The song especially feels like a pleasant surprise attack when held against the eternally put-upon rapper\xe2\x80\x99s consistently inconsistent delivery over the last few years. DROGAS Light may not surpass his auspicious debut, 2006\xe2\x80\x99s Food & Liquor, but it is easily the least scattered\xc2\xa0statement he\xe2\x80\x99s made in about a decade.' b'Not coincidentally, it is also the first album he is releasing independently after concluding his long and unhappy relationship with Atlantic Records. So rather than turning in a collection of songs that are easily sorted into column A (safer, radio-playable, label-approved) and column B (self-indulgent and somewhat superior), Lupe goes hard at a coherent sound on every single track, most pointedly on the album\xe2\x80\x99s stellar first half. But coherence is not the only or most important difference here. There\xe2\x80\x99s also an unexpected sonic strategy that finds Lupe unleashing a relentless assault of huge 808s, bomb-tick snares, and constantly chopped\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99popping vocal samples; he\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneously trying on sounds of the moment while retaining his contrarian viewpoint on modern trap trends.' b'Unchained from major-label groupthink, Lupe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go completely left with a set of stiflingly dense art-raps. Instead, many of these tracks seem purpose-built\xc2\xa0to compete with Rae Sremmurd and Migos for sheer bumpability, while lyrically running laps around them. The trap-heavy production is a major asset; 808s and psychedelic ambience provide Lupe with a vehicle for his worldview, which is critical of the genre\xe2\x80\x99s gangster tropes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou seen the movie/They killed the n***ga/Why you still wanna be like Scarface?\xe2\x80\x9d he raps on \xe2\x80\x9cNGL.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'This novel collision of style and substance is a welcome switch in approach for the rapper. Lupe never quite felt comfortable in the boom-bap lineage of backpacker rap that some fans and critics have wanted him to stick to ever since\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cKick Push\xe2\x80\x9d cast him as an unlikely torchbearer of the Native Tongues ethos back in 2006. He soon found his own mold\xe2\x80\x94a mix of West Coast and Midwest gangsta rap influences with an emo/goth-pop aesthetic that never quite worked for anybody except diehard fans. Unfortunately, a few DROGAS cuts, like \xe2\x80\x9cMade in the USA\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPick Up the Phone,\xe2\x80\x9d still fall into that underwhelming category. The filter house outing \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Not Design\xe2\x80\x9d and dance-rocky \xe2\x80\x9cWild Child\xe2\x80\x9d also feel like throwbacks to the days of base-covering radio singles\xe2\x80\x94concessions to a label boss he\xe2\x80\x99s already fired.' b'DROGAS\xe2\x80\x99 bold new sound, however, demands to be measured, less against Lupe\xe2\x80\x99s own catalog than the current field of sources\xc2\xa0he\xe2\x80\x99s drawing from and bouncing off of. The best songs on the album feel kindred in spirit to some of Kanye\xe2\x80\x99s The Life of Pablo\xc2\xa0but are nowhere near as original, transgressive, or transportive. Run the Jewels have combined 808s with subversive strains of anger and paranoia to stronger effect, not to mention Kendrick. And even compared with artists like 2 Chainz and Migos, Lupe\xe2\x80\x99s bars lack a certain snap. That\xe2\x80\x99s because he is only here to flirt and subvert\xe2\x80\x94he is not really in the moment, not really about that life. Plays on drug slang provide this album with much of its\xc2\xa0imagery\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTranquillo,\xe2\x80\x9d in particular, serves as sort of a key to the record\xe2\x80\x99s central conceit\xe2\x80\x94but overall the listener gets the sense that is Lupe still too self-conscious to\xc2\xa0truly loosen up, get lifted,\xc2\xa0and achieve the altered state that is so key to Future\xe2\x80\x99s screwed soul or Kanye\xe2\x80\x99s gospel-inflected high.' b'Ultimately, DROGAS Light reaffirms, rather than fundamentally alters, Lupe\xe2\x80\x99s place in the rap pantheon. He\xe2\x80\x99s always been too lyrical and heady to count out as an innovator in the game, even if his moves sometimes make you want to do just that. But here, with a newfound urgency to his sound, he proves once again that he is still the brainy smurf of rap.'"

The two things most people know about the Orwells is that they are young and they like to\xc2\xa0start shit, twin concerns summed up nicely on the chorus: \xe2\x80\x9cGood boys come in last/Bad girl by my side/Poppin\xe2\x80\x99 pills on the fly/Cold grave when I die.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Considering their sound, their look, their name,\xc2\xa0the zippy hooks and laddish malfeasance\xe2\x80\x94and not even counting the BBC and NME namedrops on \xe2\x80\x9cRing Pop\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Orwells probably would\xe2\x80\x99ve been called rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll\xe2\x80\x99s new saviors at least twice over by this point if they were British.' b'They might as well be, with Jim Abbiss behind the boards here. He was one of the\xc2\xa0three heavyweights responsible for producing their 2014 album\xc2\xa0Disgraceland**, along with\xc2\xa0TV on the Radio\xe2\x80\x99s Dave Sitek and Chris Coady (Beach House,\xc2\xa0Future Islands).\xc2\xa0Abbiss, meanwhile is best known for helming the\xc2\xa0Arctic Monkeys\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0canonical debut, as well as\xc2\xa0Kasabian\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Editors\xc2\xa0albums you probably haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard if you\xe2\x80\x99re American.

Rock music\xc2\xa0is still relevant, in large part because it can do other things besides conveying suburban angst\xe2\x80\x94it can comfort, confound, speak for marginalized voices or give people the energy to get the fuck out of bed.

b'Fire-Toolz',6.7,b'Drip Mental',0,b'Electronic',b'February 14 2017',"b'As Fire-Toolz, the Chicago experimentalist Angel Marcloid\xc2\xa0creates an abrasive\xc2\xa0sonic world: Mundane internet ephemera swirls around in a boiling industrial centrifuge, powered by her\xc2\xa0fearsome growl.'","b'Shortly before the turn of the century, the Chicago-based experimentalist Angel Marcloid began self-releasing electronic noise music under nearly two dozen names: WEBSITE \xe3\x83\x84, Path to Lobster Believers, and DJ Eyebrow Ring are but a few of the guises. Her\xc2\xa0first album as\xc2\xa0Fire-Toolz, Further Down the Files,\xc2\xa0arrived in 2015, followed by Even the Files Won\xe2\x80\x99t Tough You. The Fire-Toolz project is akin to\xc2\xa0a postmodern bildungsroman, transcending aesthetics, scenes, and genders.\xc2\xa0Marcloid came out as transgender during the gestation of the latter release, thereby assuming a new pedestal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like the trans-community handed me a mic and they all were standing there, staring at me blankly, waiting for me to say some angry shit,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Life Is Noise last summer: \xe2\x80\x9cIt did provide a new perspective... But I also felt like I had nothing to say, even though I was (and am) a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Certainly, Marcloid doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say much on Fire-Toolz\xe2\x80\x99s third album and Hausu Mountain debut, Drip Mental. Instead, she screams\xe2\x80\x94unleashing yell after sandpapery, cord-shredding yell, reducing words to rubble and pushing the listener\xe2\x80\x99s focus outwards into the surrounding digital din. Call it vaporwave hell: an intimidating world where mundane internet ephemera (AIM message sounds, cat purrs, library music samples) swirls around in a boiling industrial centrifuge. Marcloid\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0soundscapes are\xc2\xa0powered by IBM drum machines, cyberpunk synths, and the odd, brittle hip-hop beat. Throughout, her\xc2\xa0fearsome growl sounds straight from the throat of a black-metal banshee, alternated every so often with a disorienting, pitch-shifted rasp.' b'On \xe2\x80\x9cThe Graying of the Crocs,\xe2\x80\x9d euro-dance synths and leaden drum machines stab with reckless abandon, rendered all the more dizzying by Marcloid\xe2\x80\x99s mechanized warbling. This Auto-Tuned nightmare doubles as a facsimile for the record\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgic mission writ large: aural salves repurposed as toxins. Intermittently, the artist blesses us with an opportunity to nod our heads (\xe2\x80\x9cLibra Virgo Cusp Shit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAt the Pig Well\xe2\x80\x9d), but for every direct connection Marcloid forges with her audience, there is plenty of ugliness and abrasion.\xc2\xa0In terms of spectacular self-sabotage, it\xe2\x80\x99s on a level with\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0MTV reality starlet Farrah Abraham\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 album My Teenage Dream Ended, a similarly frankensteined pop record; the only difference is that Marcloid\xe2\x80\x99s self-immolation is intentional, and far more engrossing.' b'No matter how massive her sound, Marcloid is ultimately a deconstructionist\xe2\x80\x94if not musically, than philosophically. As with the discographies of Oneohtrix Point Never, James Ferraro, Vektroid, and other \xe2\x80\x9cpost-internet\xe2\x80\x9d luminaries, Fire-Toolz poses a timely, bleak query: How can we humans possibly hope to accomplish our starry-eyed goals of taming the machines, of finding nostalgic refuge in a void so glutted with information? *Drip Mental *serves as a scathing, passionate reminder that we can\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x94but we may as well try, or at the very least, wreak as much havoc as possible. Musical formalism, Western pop psychology, the gender binary: Marcloid\xe2\x80\x99s already laid waste to plenty of long-standing systems so far, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to cheer her on from the sidelines as\xc2\xa0she marches down the warpath.'"
b'Ornette Coleman',8.1,b'Celebrate Ornette',0,b'Jazz',b'February 13 2017',b'This new archival set documents\xc2\xa0an all-star tribute to Ornette Coleman held\xc2\xa0in 2014\xe2\x80\x94at which the saxophonist gave his last public performance\xe2\x80\x94as well as recordings\xc2\xa0from his\xc2\xa02015 funeral.',"b'Ornette Coleman was not scheduled to perform at the all-star concert held in his honor, back in the summer of 2014. That celebration, at Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s Prospect Park, was chiefly organized as a way for fans and associates to pay tribute to the saxophonist\xe2\x80\x99s legacy as an American composer and innovator. The lineup\xe2\x80\x94including talents like Henry Threadgill and Ravi Coltrane\xe2\x80\x94suggested Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s towering influence over multiple generations of jazz players. And the bill also promised elite musicians from other stylistic zones, such as Laurie Anderson and Patti Smith.' b'There aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many artists capable of drawing Flea and Branford Marsalis into the same orbit. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to understand how Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s boisterous catalog does this. Once you strip away all the baggage associated with \xe2\x80\x9cfree jazz\xe2\x80\x9d (never Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s preferred term), you\xe2\x80\x99re left with the joyful idiosyncrasy of that sound. Many of his melodies and solos channel traditional song styles, while his arrangements and harmonies are frequently unexpected\xe2\x80\x94and inspired. Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s interest in collaboration, whether with Jerry Garcia or the Master Musicians of Jajouka, also sets a high standard for risk-taking that can appeal to artistic seekers working in any genre.' b'On the night of the 2014 Prospect Park gig, Coleman took his final risk on a public stage. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t performed for a crowd in several years; his last official recording was 2006\xe2\x80\x99s Pulitzer prize-winning Sound Grammar. In the interim, journalists and fans passed on rumors regarding the genius\xe2\x80\x99 failing health. So when the 84-year-old Coleman emerged from the wings of the Prospect Park bandshell, mid-concert, with his white alto saxophone in hand, it was a modest surprise even to his son and longtime drummer, Denardo.' b'After walking out carefully and taking a seat near the other saxophonists, Ornette simply listened for a bit. Soon after, he delivered 20\xc2\xa0minutes of playing: a stretch that drew on two of his early compositions (\xe2\x80\x9cRamblin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTurnaround\xe2\x80\x9d). Within a year, he would be dead.' b'Heard now, on an archival release from Denardo Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s new Song X imprint, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s technique in 2014 was more fragile than at any other point in his immortal career. His phrases flow more slowly. Sometimes Coleman reaches for a note with audible difficulty. While his reduced physical capabilities are obvious, the spiritual intensity communicated by his playing is equally apparent\xe2\x80\x94and all the more remarkable for the context. Every elderly body confronts decline. But some veteran spirits can discover new strategies for persisting, recognizable to the last.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a frailty in Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s tone, early on, during \xe2\x80\x9cRamblin\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite the occasional tremor of timbre, there\xe2\x80\x99s no desire to hide from his limitations. And Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s way of following up a long-held, bluesy tone with a sprightly flourish of notes remains forceful, unmistakable. When Denardo\xe2\x80\x99s funk-influenced backing group comes in, a saxophone section also joins. (Their ranks include Threadgill and David Murray.) The extra players help thicken out the sound and lift Ornette up\xe2\x80\x94with the icon eventually contributing some ecstatic, piercing notes that cut through the group texture. After finishing up with his playing for the night, the saxophonist hung around on stage for a portion of the rest of the gig. What he took in was a jammy, consistently potent tribute to his catalog, and his spirit of creativity.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s thrilling to hear Threadgill\xe2\x80\x99s alto sound\xe2\x80\x94one conscious of Ornette\xe2\x80\x99s style, but not overly indebted to it\xe2\x80\x94during a performance of \xe2\x80\x9cBlues Connotation.\xe2\x80\x9d (And Flea holds his own, on bass!) A powerhouse ensemble that includes Branford Marsalis, the Master Musicians of Jajouka, and Bruce Hornsby gathers for a fiery take of \xe2\x80\x9cSong X.\xe2\x80\x9d On\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPeace,\xe2\x80\x9d Ravi Coltrane\xe2\x80\x99s soprano sax leaps create an excitable feel alongside the spiky blues playing of guitarist James Blood Ulmer. And Geri Allen, the pianist with perhaps the best track record of collaborating with Coleman and his mysterious \xe2\x80\x9charmolodic\xe2\x80\x9d theory, turns in imaginative supporting lines throughout a performance of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sphinx.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The less-canonical tributes also work. Guitarist Nels Cline handles the melody of \xe2\x80\x9cSadness\xe2\x80\x9d while Thurston Moore lays down a din of expressionistic noise in the background. Laurie Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s group\xe2\x80\x94which includes avant-saxophonist John Zorn\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0bassist Bill Laswell\xe2\x80\x94creates a lyrical squall that feels fully appropriate (in part, because it often references Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s famous composition \xe2\x80\x9cLonely Woman\xe2\x80\x9d). Patti Smith plays a pair of tunes from her then-recent album Banga; the way she switches between vocals and stray blasts of clarinet comes across as a tribute to Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s own multi-instrumental practice.' b'By the time the concert closes\xe2\x80\x94with a cathartic, all-hands-on-deck rendition of \xe2\x80\x9cLonely Woman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it seems as though few aspects of the artist\xe2\x80\x99s vast playbook have been ignored. What\xe2\x80\x99s particularly touching is the knowledge that everyone thought to pull this gig together in time for Ornette to experience their love for his work.' b'Performances from Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s public funeral are also included in this new archival set. The mood of that 2015 concert is necessarily more somber than that of the the Prospect Park show, but the results are similarly intriguing, and no less star-studded. Pharoah Sanders\xe2\x80\x99 brief tenor sax solo carries an affecting tenderness. The last living member of free jazz\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural class drops by to pay his respects, as well: Cecil Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s eight-minute tribute encompasses poetry (to the confusion of some in the audience), stark-but-stately piano motifs, and one swirl of atonal density at its midpoint. It\xe2\x80\x99s a stunner.' b'As a multimedia package, Celebrate Ornette provides fans a wide range of perspectives on both shows. Its three CDs give a complete account of the Prospect Park blowout and the performances from the Riverside Church funeral. The Prospect Park discs stray from a chronological presentation, in order to create a more ideal flow for home listening. (And yes, Ornette\xe2\x80\x99s own appearances are queued up first.) A pair of DVDs also gives you visual representation of each event\xe2\x80\x94though some performances from Prospect Park are omitted, in favor of some backstage commentary from key participants. The DVD of the Riverside service also includes all eulogies and remembrances, which the audio disc breezes past. This lavish, pricey artifact isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ideal first port of entry to Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s art. But the way the set explores the cumulative impact of his work makes it a deeply rewarding experience for devoted admirers.'"
b'The Other People Place',8.8,b'Lifestyles of the Laptop Caf\xc3\xa9',1,b'Electronic',b'February 13 2017',b'The only record by Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s James Stinson as the Other People Place is prescient in imagining our current connected-yet-disconnected state.',"b'Last year, Ian Fenton (the man behind the Frozen Reeds label responsible for reissuing Julius Eastman\xe2\x80\x99s Femenine) pointed out a parallel between the artwork that adorned Detroit electronic duo Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s albums and the illustrations made by Emory Douglas, artist and Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party. It came as a history rediscovered, re-connecting the black roots of techno back to its heritage of protest. Listen closer to the frenzied tracks that James Stinson and Gerald Donald crafted over their ten years as Drexciya and the anger is audible. For all of their electro and techno roots, Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s live wire tracks (some clocking in at two minutes) always felt closer to the furious outbursts of punk. Which made sense, as the group\xe2\x80\x99s origin story was a brutal one: Drexciya was the duo\xe2\x80\x99s name for an underwater country colonized by the unborn children of pregnant African women thrown off of slave ships during the Middle Passage. It read less like science-fiction/fantasy and more about the modern horror and cornerstone of our American reality.' b'But by the time James Stinson released what would be his lone solo album as The Other People Place, that anger had been somewhat tempered. By turns luminous and melancholic, low-key and sensuous, wry and soulful, Lifestyles of the Laptop Caf\xc3\xa9 hinted at new vistas for Stinson. He had talked about touring, a rarity for the reclusive duo. But Lifestyles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had a more star-crossed release, coming out on September 3, 2001 and vanishing soon after. Less than a year later, Stinson would be dead due to heart complications, *Lifestyles *the last record to be released during his lifetime.' b'For the duration of Drexciya, neither member revealed their names, so attempting to draw a biographical connection is haphazard at best. That said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleness and humanity to Stinson\xe2\x80\x99s programming and production as The Other People Place that makes it sound like a reconciliation of fate, a looking back at the world around him not in anger but instead with a twinge of heartache and a smile. That sensibility seeps through Stinson\xe2\x80\x99s machines and makes it stand apart in Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s catalog. As such, it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect gateway for those standing at the banks of their oceanic body of work looking for a way into its depths.' b'Stinson conveys rich sentiment with the slightest of gestures. With a few hums, the tap of a ride cymbal, and rippling pads, \xe2\x80\x9cEye Contact\xe2\x80\x9d casts a spell, both seductive and a little silly. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething\xe2\x80\x99s happening to my transmitters/Starting to overload/Sitting here in this caf\xc3\xa9/Drinking my latte,\xe2\x80\x9d he purrs two minutes in\xe2\x80\x94adding some Chicago acid vocals (think Adonis\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNo Way Back\xe2\x80\x9d) reconfigured for the Starbucks set.' b'By 2001, the \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Wave of Coffee\xe2\x80\x9d was upon us and Starbucks seemed to be on every street corner, one of the few places to enabled users to have high-speed internet access. Stinson looks out onto a world increasingly disassociated, communicating by computers instead of voices. Rather than replicate caf\xc3\xa9 society and its public conversations, said caf\xc3\xa9s now feel eerily sterile and near silent, patron faces lit by the glow of phones and laptops. It makes for a sad state\xe2\x80\x94or as the last single from The Other People Place put it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSorrow & A Cup Of Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Beneath the skittering 808s, unsettled chords and fidgety songs, a sense of melancholy and resignation flow. The twinkling keys Stinson sets atop \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Your Love\xe2\x80\x9d set off his digitally treated voice, so that he sounds like a heartbroken alien, wistfully sighing: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s your love that\xe2\x80\x99s keeping me so lost.\xe2\x80\x9d A female vocalist whispers across the snares and swelling synths of \xe2\x80\x9cYou Said You Want Me,\xe2\x80\x9d but as the track flickers its seductiveness gets balanced by sadness and failure to connect, that \xe2\x80\x9cwant\xe2\x80\x9d turning into the past tense. Even the anthemic electro of \xe2\x80\x9cLet Me Be Me\xe2\x80\x9d has a bittersweet tinge, its chords opening little wormholes of doubt.' b'The title itself cheekily suggests a room full of people, mute and withdrawn into themselves and their devices, so that even a song like \xe2\x80\x9cEye Contact\xe2\x80\x9d reads not as eyes interlocking on the dancefloor but rather two people who can only connect via their laptops. It\xe2\x80\x99s prescient in imagining our current connected-yet-disconnected state, our daily lives increasingly valuing FaceTime over face time, and the album itself anticipates a shift in how people even interact with electronic music, geared more towards home listening than the club. The album ends on a hopeful note though. \xe2\x80\x9cSunrays\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with its bubbling melody, placid ticks and a female voice whispering \xe2\x80\x9crelax your mind/slowly unwind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94sounds like Roy Ayers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody Loves the Sunshine\xe2\x80\x9d for the new century. It\xe2\x80\x99s a warm sunbeam that can best be felt away from a laptop screen.'"
b'Jesca Hoop',7.3,b'Memories Are Now',0,b'Folk/Country',b'February 13 2017',"b'Jesca Hoop\xe2\x80\x99s fourth album Memories Are Now sounds like her most complete and refined statement yet, a boisterously declarative album that\xe2\x80\x99s urgent and at times seditious.'","b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnimal Kingdom Chaotic,\xe2\x80\x9d the centerpiece of Jesca Hoop\xe2\x80\x99s fourth album, opens with a sound that may take a moment or two to identify. That clacking rhythm certainly sounds like an old-school typewriter rather than a computer keyboard, which may be her slyest joke in a song about life lived online. \xe2\x80\x9cI say it is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, then answers herself: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6but your computer says no!\xe2\x80\x9d That phrase becomes a testy mantra, its cadence growing trickier with each repetition. As Hoop\xe2\x80\x99s guitar provides a nimble, eye-rolling commentary, sounding more and more like an African mbira, the song resembles a folkie take on Laurie Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s giddily eccentric art-pop arrangements. Computer screens, the implication goes, have turned us into a population of proxies who simulate doing things more than we actually do things.' b'Hoop can\xe2\x80\x99t be accused of not doing things. In the last ten years, she has released four official studio albums, plus a handful of acoustic compilations, although readers may know her from Love Letter for Fire, her duets record with Sam Beam. But Memories Are Now sounds like her most complete and refined statement yet, a boisterously declarative album that\xe2\x80\x99s urgent and at times seditious. As such, it can be unruly and unfocused, full of ideas half- and wholly formed, the occasional jarring transition, and a few interminable passages (\xe2\x80\x9cSimon Says\xe2\x80\x9d is just over three minutes, but sounds like it will never end.)' b'However, from such disorder springs an animating sense of outrage: a readiness to take on the world from every angle of attack. That comes through most boldly on the title track, which opens with a slowly revving guitar and moves at an imperturbable crawl, subdued yet taut and disciplined. Hoop\xe2\x80\x99s vocals are much wilder: \xe2\x80\x9cMemories are now!\xe2\x80\x9d she exclaims, defiantly. She might be arguing about the temporal displacement of online\xc2\xa0life (the internet\xc2\xa0is a recurring character in these songs), where the past and the present fuse together and the future never quite arrives. Or she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get at something a bit more banal: Every moment is precious and has the potential to become a memory.' b'Hoop is making memories, whether you like it or not: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got work to be doing,\xe2\x80\x9d she declares. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not here to help, go find some other life to ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d If the melody weren\xe2\x80\x99t so intricately snaky, if the hook didn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on her odd phrasing, that chorus might be the kind of thing you\xe2\x80\x99d chant while marching on the White House\xe2\x80\x94especially when she gets to the line, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me show you the door.\xe2\x80\x9d Memories Are Now, perhaps more than anything she has done in the past, is closely engaged with the present moment, yet so lyrically and musically idiosyncratic that it never sounds overtly political. The best moments possess a sense of intrigue, a subterranean conspiracy, as though she\xe2\x80\x99s imparting dangerous knowledge to you.' b'Hoop\xe2\x80\x99s most visceral assault is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Coming,\xe2\x80\x9d which opens with a few measures of ambient guitar noodling, as though she\xe2\x80\x99s gathering her thoughts or summoning her courage. As the song sprawls and contorts, Jesus resigns as Messiah and laments a tenure defined by double standards and misunderstood instructions. If there was nothing but this performance review, the song would be merely clever, but it takes on tremendous gravity the more personal Hoop gets: \xe2\x80\x9cI refuse to think that my best friend\xe2\x80\x99s going to hell anymore and condescend to offer her a key to salvation like it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I have and can afford,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, but she\xe2\x80\x99s past singing by this point. Instead, she\xe2\x80\x99s testifying about a \xe2\x80\x9cspirit-rattling scare\xe2\x80\x9d: the realization that the moral code that has defined America for so long has curdled into something grotesque and virulent. Hoop has the temerity to fight against it, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re not here to help...well, you know.'"

Coming from a time when West Africa was full of military rulers and one-party states fueled by oil money, the compilation provides sneaky testimony that the region flourished culturally all the same. Some collectors might grumble that there\xe2\x80\x99s a few overlaps with Stone Throw\xe2\x80\x99s excellent 2005 comp World Psychedelic Classics 3. AA3 has no big names except for Manu Dibango (\xe2\x80\x9cSoul Makossa\xe2\x80\x9d), with a number of groups only existing for a few singles or an album. The tunes are mostly instrumentals, sprinkled with occasional vocals (many times in English) scattered in the lo-fi mixes, leaning more towards guitar freak-outs and tropicalia itself. And even though many of AA3 songs are complex, multi-part journeys, most of them still confine themselves to the classic under-five-minutes single format.' b'What\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary about these otherwise forgotten, barely existent singles isn\xe2\x80\x99t just their dynamic, insistent groove but also how each piece giddily slices across traditions and styles as much as it honors them.

b'Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke',9.1,b'Bad Timing',0,b'Experimental',b'February 12 2017',b'Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s 1997 album Bad Timing\xc2\xa0turns his obsessions with Americana into a\xc2\xa0tangle of deep reverence and exuberant skepticism.',"b'In the early 1990s, years before he joined Sonic Youth or partnered with Wilco or tried his hand at singing, Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke was a kind of prodigy in the experimental music underground. He recorded albums in his early twenties for labels like Sound of Pig, Amsterdam\xe2\x80\x99s Staalplaat, and John Zorn\xe2\x80\x99s Tzadik. He made music with whatever was at hand and was proficient on many instruments, and he often performed in the context of free improvisation. But O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s first instrument was guitar, and one of his deepest musical loves was the art of arrangement\xe2\x80\x94the precise placement of this note in this pocket of space, the choice of this instrument for that note. The two obsessions met in glorious fashion on his 1997 album Bad Timing.' b'In the 21st century, we take music built around steel-string guitar for granted. New practitioners have emerged (William Tyler, James Blackshaw, Ben Chasny), a latter-day legend has come and gone (Jack Rose, R.I.P.), and an endless series of reissues of albums by major figures stream by (hello, Bert Jansch). But 20 years ago, the notion of solo acoustic guitar as a medium for expression of album-length ideas was only just emerging from hibernation. Some of its resurgence during that period could be traced to the work of critic Byron Coley, who had written an article in SPIN in 1994, in which he\xe2\x80\x99d tracked down the then-obscure John Fahey in Oregon. Fahey had barely recorded in the few years\xc2\xa0previous, and was living off the grid and on the edge of poverty, occasionally sleeping in homeless shelters. That SPIN piece, along with the Rhino compilation Return of the Repressed, which put his out-of-print music back in stores, cemented the guitarist\xe2\x80\x99s status as an icon of American music. Neither he, nor his instrument, have left the conversation since.' b'In North America, the acoustic guitar is often associated\xc2\xa0with \xe2\x80\x9cfolk\xe2\x80\x9d music of a certain mood; from 1970s singer-songwriters to the \xe2\x80\x9980s emergence of new age and then onto the rise of \xe2\x80\x9cunplugged\xe2\x80\x9d music in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, the acoustic became associated with relaxation, intimacy, quiet contemplation\xe2\x80\x94a sound ostensibly more closely connected to the natural world than its electric counterpart. But Fahey\xe2\x80\x99s vision for acoustic guitar was something else entirely. He was among the first to fully grasp that the instrument had uniquely expressive qualities, that its possibilities as a device for melody, harmony, and rhythm were untapped, and alternate tunings gave it further flexibility other instruments couldn\xe2\x80\x99t match. In Fahey\xe2\x80\x99s hands, the guitar became an orchestra in miniature, and long, multi-part pieces with the thunderous sweep of a symphony could sit alongside rustic evocations of the past. Fahey\xe2\x80\x99s guitar became a tool for collapsing time and space, able to incorporate the grand sweep of music history in a flurry of strummed chords, fingerpicked melodies, and raga-like repeating rhythms.' b'Fahey\xe2\x80\x99s mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s resurgence served as a backdrop for Bad Timing, and the connection colored how it was received at the time. The Fahey connect was further underscored by O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s earlier work in Gastr del Sol, his post-rock duo with David Grubbs (they covered Fahey on their 1996 album Upgrade & Afterlife.) But while *Bad Timing *has deep spiritual connections to Fahey\xe2\x80\x99s work, the actual music comes from a very different place. You could almost think of Bad Timing as as a record that\xe2\x80\x99s *trying *to be a Fahey album but keeps getting derailed and ends up going somewhere even more interesting. It was originally written to be a solo guitar record, and O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke has performed versions of the pieces in that setting, but as he worked on the music, he decided he wanted to take it into another direction, one that would incorporate his obsession with carefully arranged sound.' b""Expanding *Bad Timing *allowed O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke to paint on a much larger canvas. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me both Happy Days and Bad Timing were about my myths,\xe2\x80\x9d O'Rourke explained to writer Mike McGonigal in a 1997 interview in the zine Music. \xe2\x80\x9cA big part of my head is Americana. But the Americana I know comes from listening to Van Dyke Parks, John Fahey, and Charles Ives. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist, and I have to face the fact that it doesn't exist. I have to address that it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but a construct.\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke has always wrestled with the \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d part of record-making. He\xe2\x80\x99s an avid and thoughtful listener and has absorbed a mountain of music, so with each project, he considers exactly why he should be adding to the pile. Bad Timing may be\xc2\xa0an homage to some of his heroes, but he takes their collective influence and bends it into a peculiar shape, a tangle of deep reverence and exuberant skepticism. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fantasy that is aware of itself as fantasy, a self-conscious evocation of an individual artist\xe2\x80\x99s obsessions that also functions as a neat historical snapshot."" b'Parks\xe2\x80\x99 lush arrangements and his gentle irony; Fahey\xe2\x80\x99s vast scope; Ives\xe2\x80\x99 clash of folk simplicity and avant-garde dissonance\xe2\x80\x94these elements\xc2\xa0are all over Bad Timing, and minimalism is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it draws heavily from the music of other cultures, particularly India, minimalism as a compositional technique is closely identified with American icons, in particular the work of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, and LaMonte Young. Glass, Reich, and Riley are best known for repetition\xe2\x80\x94they build meaning through gradually shifting clusters of sound. Young\xe2\x80\x99s music has alternated between repetition and carefully tuned and deeply physical drone. Two other composers, Phill Niblock and Tony Conrad, both of whom O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke work with, further extended Young\xe2\x80\x99s drone conceptions. For this group, held tones become a form of change; from moment to moment in a drone piece, you expect shifts and development to happen, and when they don\xe2\x80\x99t, you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly re-discovering where you are in the now.' b'*Bad Timing *has this mercurial quality. It flows beautifully and is easy for a newcomer to enjoy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a series of head-fakes, regular juxtapositions that jar the music off course as it moves from one mode to the next. The opening \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Hell in Hello But More in Goodbye\xe2\x80\x9d starts off almost as a carbon-copy of Fahey in his most whimsical mode, with a sunny finger-picked melody that one could imagine a turn-of-the-century farmer whistling as he strolled across a field. But after a few bars, it drops into a single repeating pattern played on just a small handful of notes, like a needle slipping into a skipping groove, and it stays there, as a lone chord is examined, poked at, and wrung dry. Other subtle instruments fold in\xe2\x80\x94organ, piano\xe2\x80\x94and as \xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\x9d unfurls it becomes a pure drone piece, quieter and prettier but not so far from the Niblock-inspired hurdy-gurdy blast that defined O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s previous album, Happy Days. What started as \xe2\x80\x9cfolk\xe2\x80\x9d ends as a kind of raga meditation.' b'This kind of shell game happens throughout Bad Timing, as the individual pieces convince you they\xe2\x80\x99re one thing while they\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of becoming something else. \xe2\x80\x9c94 the Long Way\xe2\x80\x9d opens with a tentative, lurching fingerpicked section, hinting at possible songs behind it, but not quite committing, until finally a pattern emerges that mixes a lurching bass-string loop, repetition in the middle register, and a simple descending three-note melody that becomes the center around which the rest of the track orbits. It at first sounds too simple, like it\xe2\x80\x99s barely even a melody, but O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke adds cheery keyboards, gorgeous pedal steel guitar, and trombone, and it starts to feel like a John Philip Sousa march\xe2\x80\x94you think of fireworks and parades and kazoos and guys in funny hats and rolling expanses of land stretching to the horizon.' b'The construction of the piece is impressive as new instruments are added every few bars and they all lock into place. But there\xe2\x80\x99s also something joyously silly about it all, a cartoon of civic engagement. The bumptious cheeriness evokes children performing an exaggerated \xe2\x80\x9cwhistle while you work\xe2\x80\x9d march, pounding forward in service of some high-minded collective ideal. The hint of camp extends further. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always taken the \xe2\x80\x9c94\xe2\x80\x9d in the title to be a reference to I-94, the interstate highway that runs through Chicago. If you\xe2\x80\x99re in the Midwest and you want to take a road trip, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost certainly going to find yourself in I-94 at some point. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s song can be heard as an ode\xc2\xa0to the freeway, his acoustic Americana version of Kraftwerk\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAutobahn\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the structure of the two songs is similar, and the snaking pedal steel is evocative of the gliding guitar in the Kraftwerk tune. It\xe2\x80\x99s a soundtrack for looking out the window as you roll through the farmland of Wisconsin and Minnesota.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cAmericana\xe2\x80\x9d is an inexhaustible descriptor entirely dependent on perspective. American music, after all, is by its nature fractured, a bottomless\xc2\xa0well of influences that zig-zag around the country and then around the world. Hyper-local folk forms are \xe2\x80\x9cdiscovered\xe2\x80\x9d and stolen from and then sold back in a gnarled form by professionals from far away. Aaron Copland, composer of \xe2\x80\x9cFanfare for the Common Man,\xe2\x80\x9d was a gay, cosmopolitan Jew with communist sympathies, and he created work steeped in American myths, dreaming up places where he might not be entirely comfortable (or welcome) if he were to actually visit them. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s musical fantasy is steeped in the past but also feels ripe with the possibility of the present moment; it\xe2\x80\x99s *of *history but it sits outside of it.' b'The second side of *Bad Timing *is essentially a single 20-minute piece split into two sections that grows steadily stranger while playing with ideas of nostalgia and memory. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke presents ancient notions of \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican music\xe2\x80\x9d and then toys with them. The title track opens with another playful folk guitar figure before losing itself in haze of keyboard melody. For minutes on end, the song seesaws between two slowly plucked chords as hints of accordion nudge the tune along. You keep listening for changes, and you think you *might *hear something shifting, but you\xe2\x80\x99re also happy to get lost in the repetition, the simple twinkling beauty and building tension of the arrangement.' b'And then it explodes: a huge distorted power chord launches us into \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Trails,\xe2\x80\x9d the final piece. Suddenly we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of a psychedelic rock record, and it\xe2\x80\x99s like a light switch thrown on, or explosive laughter that sucks the discomfort out of a room. After the lengthy fallout from that blast, there\xe2\x80\x99s another extended fingerpicked acoustic passage, and then the song is overwhelmed with a crashing marching band fanfare (a possible nod to Charles Ives\xe2\x80\x99 Symphony No. 4, where a brooding string passage is interrupted by blasts of horns that sound borrowed from another piece). Adding further contrast, pedal steel guitarist Ken Champion, whose impossibly beautiful swells of sound add so much poignancy to \xe2\x80\x9c94 the Long Way,\xe2\x80\x9d returns with a downright loopy solo fit for the Country Bear Jamboree. Then the song sunsets in a golden-purple haze of muted horns, returning to uncanny beauty one final time.' b'This seesaw between mischievous subversion and slack-jawed beauty is the key to O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s best music. His sense of humor is both generous and slightly dark; there\xe2\x80\x99s irony in his touch, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a negating one. It\xe2\x80\x99s more about being open to hearing every possibility in a given piece of music. In a\xc2\xa02001 interview O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke was asked if *Bad Timing *had an element of parody. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a parody at all, or infatuation, it\xe2\x80\x99s more like trying to reconcile what is imagined, learned, real, and imaginary.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he added, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it really that impossible to believe that something can be funny and sincere at the same time?\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Bad Timing, and O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s solo career that followed, is a convincing argument for creation in the face of self-consciousness. The \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d of music-making is under-explored. Does your individual record need to exist? For O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, and especially for his solo albums on Drag City, he justifies their release by lavishing care on every detail, and embracing the music of the past in all its complexity. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke has always been very careful about how his music is packaged and presented. He only allowed it to be released digitally in the last couple of years, and the downloads on Drag City\xe2\x80\x99s newly created Bandcamp pages urge the listener to \xe2\x80\x9cplease download the best possible quality.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s fighting against his music being reduced, whether that means shrinking the artwork, compressing the digital files, or removing individual tracks from the context of the whole. He\xe2\x80\x99s asking for a lot from the listener, but\xc2\xa0giving even more in return. *Bad Timing *was where so many of these ideas came together for the first time, a glorious imaginary world that becomes real every time it plays.'"

This new compilation from Clone Records surveys their curio of a catalog.'","b'Adam Lee Miller and Ian Clarke met as art students in Detroit in the late 1990s, and from \xe2\x80\x9996 to \xe2\x80\x9998, they released four projects as the electro/techno group Le Car. The titles of those\xc2\xa0releases betrayed their vehicular interest: Auto-Fuel,\xc2\xa0Auto-Graph,\xc2\xa0Automatic, and\xc2\xa0Auto-Motif. Le Car\xe2\x80\x99s entrance into the city\xe2\x80\x99s nightlife came a full decade after the Belleville Three (Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, Derrick May) invented Detroit techno, which May once colorfully described as\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9clike George Clinton and Kraftwerk caught in an elevator with only a sequencer to keep them company.\xe2\x80\x9d In that sense, Clarke and Miller (later of the electronic duo ADULT.) draw influence from this local\xc2\xa0lineage.\xc2\xa0Le Car, if it is not obvious in their choice of names, are heavily inspired by the sleek, robot automation and cybernetic tendencies of Kraftwerk.' b'In practice, Le Car\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0work demonstrates an almost endearingly uncool attempt to reinterpret \xe2\x80\x9cThe Robots,\xe2\x80\x9d if they were reborn in the bodies of Detroit area art students. And if that either sounds bad or good to you, both the worst and best outcomes are available in Clone Records\xe2\x80\x99 new compilation and survey of their discography, Auto-Reverse.' b'The opening track, \xe2\x80\x9cCar Scene One,\xe2\x80\x9d begins with a question. A helium-inflected voice pulls up to a stranger and asks if they\xe2\x80\x99d like a ride. The stranger, with a deeper, metallic, but equally inhuman baritone, cheerfully agrees. Then they turn on the radio, and a brief gurgle of electric noise plays. It\xe2\x80\x99s percussive, vaguely groovy, but rigid: the kind of music the robot overlords in *The Matrix might play at parties. The car stalls, the radio stops\xe2\x80\x94barely a minute and half in, *it is immediately clear things are not what they seem to be. This gesture of artistic malfunction makes their connection to Kraftwerk even more apparent. It recalls the German group\xe2\x80\x99s own 1970s electronic epiphany: During one show,\xc2\xa0Ralf H\xc3\xbctter put so much weight down on his keyboard that the wild crowd just kept on dancing \xe2\x80\x9cto the machine.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The compilers of this\xc2\xa0collection cleverly recognize that so much of Le Car\xe2\x80\x99s music feels like the\xc2\xa0afterglow of such a moment.\xc2\xa0The cheeky loops of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAluminum Rectangles\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWarm Humans\xe2\x80\x9d conjure up seconds of late-night sound\xc2\xa0that unintentionally hang in the air,\xc2\xa0playing out when\xc2\xa0no one is behind the board. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that Le Car\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0songs are shapeless, but they are in so many ways formulaic.\xc2\xa0There is something about the music of Le Car that is distinctly campy, simple, and repetitive in the way arcade games are.\xc2\xa0Even though their synthesizer loops sometimes lose steam, and some of the tracks feel more like fragmentary studies than club-oriented experiences, their music represents an earnest attempt to make real life feel virtual. But as the endless march of technology can attest, their experiments feel hilariously anachronistic in the light of the present day.' b'While there are a number of standouts in the 20 tracks\xe2\x80\x94including the triumphant early chiptune of \xe2\x80\x9cMalice,\xe2\x80\x9d and the acidic beat of \xe2\x80\x9cAudiofile 10\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the compilation presents Le Car in an incidentally\xc2\xa0satirical light, like a caricature of techno.\xc2\xa0But the exuberance of Miller and Clarke is undeniable. There is a relentlessly cheery aspect to their music that makes it hard to hate. Even if *Auto-Reverse *might just be a curio, it documents a brief pocket of time that feels feels quaint, fun, and fresh today, like that pair JNCO jeans hidden deep in your closet.'"
b'Stef Chura',7.2,b'Messes',0,b'Rock',b'February 11 2017',"b""Detroit indie rocker Stef Chura's lowlit, burnished debut Messes showcases her way with setting a twilit mood and her magnetic, mutable voice.""","b'Detroit indie rocker Stef Chura has the kind of magnetic voice that music writers fall into ditches attempting to describe. Froggy, trembling, and full of unexpected catches, it sits in the forefront of her debut album Messes, and she often uses her finger-picked guitars behind it to trace and echo her vocal melody, framing for maximum scrutiny. She seems confident with her instrument\xc2\xa0and to grasp how it works, the same way a good character actor knows how to use their pointy chin, their waggling nose, or their thick eyebrows. Breath to breath, note to note, she\xc2\xa0 evokes different singers: On \xe2\x80\x9cFaded Heart\xe2\x80\x9d she sounds like Stevie Nicks impersonating Dan Bejar. On \xe2\x80\x9cSlow Motion,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalls Television\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Verlaine, while on \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x9d she channels the velvety longeurs of\xc2\xa0Chrissie Hynde.' b'Nevertheless, she retains complete control of this unruly, coltish instrument, even as it tramples over small stuff like enunciation and diction. On paper, her lyrics are poetic and sharply rendered (\xe2\x80\x9cThin like the skin on a lottery ticket\xe2\x80\x9d) but the journey from the page through her larynx is a rough one, and a line as simple as \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do that\xe2\x80\x9d (the hollered chorus from \xe2\x80\x9cSpotted Gold\xe2\x80\x9d) can turn into an eleven-syllable phonetic rollercoaster with no discernible entry or exit point. The lyrics suggest the\xc2\xa0album\xe2\x80\x99s title\xc2\xa0refers to the sorts of messes we make of each other (\xe2\x80\x9cPutting in overtime/To get my revenge on you/I can see in your eyes/There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing left to lose\xe2\x80\x9d) while her voice itself shows what can happen when a perfectly clear-seeming thought gets garbled by its expression. It\xe2\x80\x99s a metaphor for the gulf separating what we mean to say and what others hear, maybe.' b'Or maybe just an odd voice. In any case, Messes is alluring largely\xc2\xa0because of it, and the band surrounding her reinforces that allure. They play a simple style\xe2\x80\x94roughshod, lowlit indie rock, with guitars and voice all flickering around the same burnished midrange\xe2\x80\x94with quiet style and intuitive command. The music mostly stays at a mid-tempo simmer, only boiling over for a few moments of yelped catharsis, the guitars squealing as if kicked. The drumming has just the right hairs\xe2\x80\x99-breadth hesitation holding back the downbeat, keeping the music loose and full of air. The album falls just right, like a stretched-out sweater with holes in the collar.' b""Messes, true to its title, feels inchoate,\xc2\xa0a few sloppy first strokes down on a big white page that catches the eye. It would be nice if she wrote some sharper songs; while her delicate and echoey fingerpicking tangles sound nice, she maybe gets a little too lost in them. A couple drowsier songs stretch out so languorously they start to lose shape\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cHuman Being,\xe2\x80\x9d a pleasant tangle of fingerpicking and Chura\xe2\x80\x99s moan, is more mood than song. But it's a rich mood, sumptuous enough that the blurry contours don't matter much. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to indulge a reverie when it\xe2\x80\x99s a vivid one, and Messes\xc2\xa0invites you to lose track of time for awhile with it."""
b'Communions',6.5,b'Blue',0,b'Rock',b'February 11 2017',"b'The Danish rock band Communions offer a familiar sound\xe2\x80\x94vaguely Strokes-y, \xe2\x80\x9980s-inspired pop rock\xe2\x80\x94but they do it well.'","b""There\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said for familiarity. Sometimes you just want a burger to taste exactly like the one you had last time, and\xc2\xa0Blue, the full-length debut by the Danish quartet Communions, announces its ingredients right away with opener \xe2\x80\x9cCome On, I\xe2\x80\x99m Waiting.\xe2\x80\x9d Had the band added a signature Greg Hawkes-style keyboard line, it would have been even easier to imagine \xe2\x80\x9cCome On, I\xe2\x80\x99m Waiting\xe2\x80\x9d as being by the Cars. Within a few measures, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Communions aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to hide the well of styles they're drawing from."" b""If you\xe2\x80\x99re already familiar with the band's previous EPs, you know that Communions alternate between shoegaze and the meat-and-potatoes pop-rock that the Strokes sold to the world as punk/post-punk revivalism. On Blue, the smokestack plumes of guitar have mostly been cleared away in favor of a stripped-down production style that cuts closer to the bone. Second track \xe2\x80\x9cToday,\xe2\x80\x9d in fact, starts with a serrated, airtight guitar riff reminiscent of the Strokes\xe2\x80\x99 2001 debut Is This It. The similarity is so apparent that Communions may as well have tattooed the album cover onto their foreheads."" b'By this point, one has to wonder if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything left to say, musically speaking, when bands choose to go down this well-traveled road. And when you consider that acts like the Strokes and Interpol lifted so blatantly from Television in the first place, Communions risk the quality erosion that you get when you make a copy of a copy. Nevertheless, *Blue\xe2\x80\x99*s skill rescues it. After the Strokes-style riff introduces \xe2\x80\x9cToday,\xe2\x80\x9d the song switches to a looser \xe2\x80\x9980s-pop atmosphere\xc2\xa0reminiscent of the Smiths\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAsk.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'That looseness is crucial; even the album\xe2\x80\x99s basic production retains an openness that\xe2\x80\x99s inviting rather than confining.\xc2\xa0Other bands who mold themselves after these styles typically do so with a fervor that can be stifling, but\xc2\xa0Blue\xc2\xa0conveys the sense that the band simply enjoys this music.\xc2\xa0At times, Communions sound inspired, like they pushed themselves to write songs that at least show some character. At other times, the band can sound somewhat lazy, as if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t push quite hard enough. Which side of that line the songs on this album fall depends on where you draw the line yourself. Either way, the music on Blue is always lovingly crafted, and the album\xe2\x80\x99s lack of musical pretense makes for an enjoyable, if predictable listen. If Blue were a restaurant, it would be the kind of place you go to for consistency and tasteful decor when you\xe2\x80\x99re not in the mood for something fancier or more adventurous.'"

Though often overlooked (his bio defensively asserts \xe2\x80\x9cThink of Detroit Techno and DJ Bone might not be high on your list of luminaries because he is 100% independent and does things on his terms and on his terms only\xe2\x80\x9d), he has developed a small-but-rabid following for his flashy, technical and decidedly old-school approach to DJing. His productions\xe2\x80\x94often self-released on his Subject Detroit label\xe2\x80\x94adhere faithfully to the fundamental principles set forth by Underground Resistance and Jeff Mills, with tough, driving drum programming laying a solid foundation for either wide-eyed celestial synth work or teeth-gritting severity, designed to drive dancers into a frenzy. If this suggests a kind of bunker mentality, it\xe2\x80\x99s not without good reason: For many, Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s original strain of techno remains the most potent, with transatlantic exports rarely making good on the Motor City\xe2\x80\x99s exhilarating mix of meditative depth and rushing energy.' b'On It\xe2\x80\x99s Good To Be Differ-Ent, his debut album as Differ-Ent, Dulan doubles down on his hometown\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, delivering a triple LP that acts as a sort of manifesto, career encapsulation and litmus test for fans. As with many dance music albums, the format itself runs counter to the nature of the music. Simply put, listening to a long stretch of DJ tools can be a tiring affair, with extended intros and outros begging to be blended with something else. It\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that every producer who ventures outside the comfort zone of 12\xe2\x80\x9d EPs has to contend with, and Dulan does so in his signature style, by putting his head down and powering through.' b'The slightly-overwhelming eighty minutes of It\xe2\x80\x99s Good\xe2\x80\xa6 are meant strictly for DJs and heads, with plenty of bangers and little else. To be fair, this record was likely never meant to be listened to front-to-back. Each side has two songs on it, allowing you to digest each of the three 12\xe2\x80\x9ds as a standalone EP. Approached this way, the album clicks, with each third offering a slightly different side of the producer\xe2\x80\x99s work.' b'Opener \xe2\x80\x9cInhabit Tense\xe2\x80\x9d dives right in with some thick pads and pummeling, machine funk toms. This first run of songs blasts out of the gate, with Dulan\xe2\x80\x99s extrovert side in full effect. Exciting as it is, he can lapse into a predictable deference to his elders, particularly Mike Banks. The fidgety lead and blasting strings on \xe2\x80\x9cMarvel Less\xe2\x80\x9d scratch the Detroit itch well enough, but by same token feel a bit rote. No doubt in the right hands they will come alive on a dance floor, but elsewhere on the album Dulan delivers the goods with more personal aplomb.' b'The middle of the album offers some of the strangest and strongest work attributed to the Differ-Ent alias so far. \xe2\x80\x9cWe Have U Surrounded\xe2\x80\x9d pares back the sound palette, using a single liquid note and tight percussion to cast a graceful spell. \xe2\x80\x9cMotive Hate Shun\xe2\x80\x9d chokes out all the air in the room with miasmic subbass and menacing flanger\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the album\xe2\x80\x99s highlights. Perhaps meant as a counterpoint, \xe2\x80\x9cFasten 8 Shun\xe2\x80\x9d returns to Dulan\xe2\x80\x99s beloved string sounds, but here his melodies ambitiously reach beyond the clouds rather than cruise coldly into the abyss. Finally, E-side opener shows \xe2\x80\x9cGem In Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d shows Dulan\xe2\x80\x99s emotional side, reminiscent of Hieroglyphic Being\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSo Much Noise 2 Be Heard\xe2\x80\x9d if it was recorded in a real studio.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s closing stretch feels a little throwaway, with the obligatory chill-out of \xe2\x80\x9cA Calm Bliss.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s cool enough, but once it\xe2\x80\x99s over it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly resonate, and \xe2\x80\x9cLazer Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d swerves right back to the dense paranoia rather than maintain the mood. \xe2\x80\x9cI M Different\xe2\x80\x9d closes the album in a more electro style. He may not actually be that different from his Detroit forebears, but It\xe2\x80\x99s Good To Be Differ-Ernt does stand apart from much modern techno. Orthodox but accomplished, it\xe2\x80\x99s an album that exists outside time, sidestepping fashionable tropes staying true to it\xe2\x80\x99s roots. However, it may be more rewarding for the casual fan to catch Bone in one of his virtuosic DJ sets than here.'"
b'Surfer Blood',6.9,b'Snowdonia',0,b'Rock',b'February 10 2017',"b'After the death of guitarist Thomas Fekete last year, Surfer Blood return with an album shadowed\xc2\xa0by grief. Paradoxically, it\xe2\x80\x99s their sunniest and loosest record in years.'","b'Surfer Blood\xe2\x80\x99s fourth album Snowdonia arrives with something the band hasn\xe2\x80\x99t experienced in a long time: good will. After frontman John Paul Pitts\xe2\x80\x99 2012 arrest for domestic battery instantly transformed the band from potential indie-rock mainstays into permanently damaged goods, he at times seemed to carry on the group out of sheer spite. Their 2013 album Pythons opened with him eating literal sour grapes and only got nastier from there; listeners understandably steered clear of it. Even the fans who jumped off the band\xe2\x80\x99s surf board long ago, however, had to feel for the group last year when they lost guitarist Thomas Fekete to stomach cancer. He was only 27 years old. \xc2\xa0Snowdonia may be the closest Surfer Blood gets to a second chance, and it poses a test for Pitts: Can he really be the kind of frontman that listeners empathize with, and maybe even care for, again?' b'He certainly puts his best face forward. There\xe2\x80\x99s no trace of opportunism on Snowdonia\xe2\x80\x94no bitterness, no self-pity, no overstatement of grief. Instead, Pitts uses the terrible circumstances as a chance for reinvention. With a shuffled lineup that includes new guitarist Michael McCleary and bassist Lindsey Mills, whose harmony vocals lend welcome warmth to the record, he recasts Surfer Blood as the kinder, gentler guitar-pop band they might have been better off trying to be a couple album cycles ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s their calmest record, a relaxed, sunny outing pitched at the same volume as The Feelies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0casual late \xe2\x80\x9980s LPs.' b'This is not the same Pitts who blasted through walls, sledgehammers swinging, on \xe2\x80\x9cSwim,\xe2\x80\x9d nor is he the same bitter soul who played the victim so passive-aggressively on Pythons. He sounds about 90 anger management sessions removed from that guy, and the lyrics are peppered with promises that he\xe2\x80\x99s a changed man. \xe2\x80\x9cThought I had a corroded heart/Oxidizing, torn apart/Now you\xe2\x80\x99re starting it up yet again,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, brimming with hope on the Inverted World-esque \xe2\x80\x9cDino Jay.\xe2\x80\x9d And rather than reaching for that bowl of sour grapes again, \xe2\x80\x9cMatter of Time\xe2\x80\x9d opens the album with an assurance that Pitts\xe2\x80\x99 aim is true this time: \xe2\x80\x9cIn a world so full of murky intentions, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make ourselves a home.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s really trying to make the best of things, he insists.' b'Given the circumstances, Snowdonia is a surprisingly light album. With its paisley guitars and Sunday drive tempos, many listeners would be hard pressed to even locate the grief on first listen. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nifty trick that the song that most directly touches on Fekete\xe2\x80\x99s death is also the album\xe2\x80\x99s most mirthful: \xe2\x80\x9cSix Flags in F or G\xe2\x80\x9d builds from a \xe2\x80\x9cRock Lobster\xe2\x80\x9d tempo to a confetti\xc2\xa0burst of Mamas and the Papas-style sunshine pop before signing off with some Wowee Zowee guitar scribbles. Instead of making a big display of their bereavement, they pay tribute to their friend with some sounds he always enjoyed. A similarly sweet pragmatism carries through closer \xe2\x80\x9cCarrier Pigeon,\xe2\x80\x9d a heartbreaker he wrote after his mother\xe2\x80\x99s breast cancer diagnosis. He responds not by cursing the cruel hand, but constructively, with an appreciation for the woman who always looked out for him and his sister: \xe2\x80\x9cI know you swam upstream for most of your life, dodging the grizzlies.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s never sounded closer to the songwriter we were promised on Astro Coast.' b""So does Snowdonia mark a redemption for a once toxic band? As with all issues surrounding the art/artist divide, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so clear cut. One tactful album can\xe2\x80\x99t buy a musician forgiveness any more than it can erase the pain of losing a loved one. And in truth, Snowdonia probably isn't a flashy enough album to re-spark significant interest in the band anyway. At their early peak, this group had a serious wow factor; now they're mostly setting out for modest pleasures. For the first time in five years, though, this band has a reason to exist, and possibly even a path forward. It\xe2\x80\x99s Surfer Blood\xe2\x80\x99s first album since their debut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t invite you to think about what could have been. It simply makes the most of what is."""

The 20-song\xc2\xa0*Bye Bye Berta *is their first attempt at doing so longform.'","b'Palberta take joy in confusion. Formed in New York\xe2\x80\x99s Hudson Valley at Bard College, the trio of Lily Konigsberg, Anina Ivry-Block, and Nina Ryser has spent the last few years baffling audiences in the Northeast DIY scene with brief blasts of broken rounds, abstract nursery rhymes, and\xc2\xa0jittery haphazard rhythms that speed to cartoonish extremes or slow down to a crawl seemingly on a whim. Despite the anti-hero virtuosity that they each demonstrate on guitar, bass, and drums, Ivry-Block has said in interviews that she\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnever really learned how to play songs on the guitar or really any of the instruments.\xe2\x80\x9d Consequently, their sound is largely in line with the post-punk era\xe2\x80\x99s great experimentalists\xe2\x80\x94This Heat\xe2\x80\x99s rattlesnake coils of toxic rhythmic interplay, Sun City Girls\xe2\x80\x99 prankish melodies\xe2\x80\x94but they approach these sounds with a sort of overloaded glee, crashing and careening through styles and sounds for little more than a couple minutes at a time. Then, they\xe2\x80\x99ll awkwardly trade instruments before barreling through another sub-two-minute track.' b'They\xe2\x80\x99ve released a couple of tapes and splits\xe2\x80\x94most notably 2013\xe2\x80\x99s *My Pal Berta *and 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Shitheads in the Ditch\xe2\x80\x94that attempted to bottle their delirious energy, but at 20-songs long, *Bye Bye Berta *is their first real attempt at doing so longform. The effect, even through just the first couple of bite-sized pieces, is jarring and deliberately so. Within five minutes, Konigsberg, Ivry-Block, and Ryser tunnel through dazed chorales (\xe2\x80\x9cWhy Didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d), discordant speed blues (\xe2\x80\x9cAcoustic Rollup\xe2\x80\x9d), bracing\xc2\xa0noise rock (\xe2\x80\x9cJaws\xe2\x80\x9d), and narcotized concr\xc3\xa9te (\xe2\x80\x9cBells Pt. B\xe2\x80\x9d). The stylistic hopscotch is unsettling, but playful, something like attempting to hop onto a speeding carousel. Even as you start to feel sickly, you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but hang on tight.' b'Compared to some of the more outr\xc3\xa9 experiments they\xe2\x80\x99ve slipped onto singles and splits since Shitheads, the sounds that make up *Bye Bye Berta *feel especially well-considered. It\xe2\x80\x99s a strange thing to say about a record that has an intentionally misremembered\xe2\x80\x94and largely off-key\xe2\x80\x94rendition of the Bee Gees\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cStayin Alive,\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Palberta are\xc2\xa0giving real thought to the diverse textures they can wring out of their instruments. \xe2\x80\x9cShe Feels That Way,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, is presented first as a sparse, unplugged ballad. It\xe2\x80\x99s then\xc2\xa0followed by\xc2\xa0a noisy, rumbling version of the same track\xe2\x80\x94the original\xe2\x80\x99s toy piano plinks are scoured by the brillo-tough, barely-in-tune guitar lines. These two versions of the same loose, spectral melody show it plainly,\xc2\xa0but\xc2\xa0Palberta never really repeat a specific sound between songs, even with their limited instrumental palette. It only adds to the euphoric disjunct of the record as a whole.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s happened elsewhere in Palberta\xe2\x80\x99s catalog, but on Bye Bye Berta\xe2\x80\x99s eighth track, \xe2\x80\x9cTrick Ya,\xe2\x80\x9d they finally break. As their atonal skronk and single line of lyrics\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t trick me! I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna trick ya\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94accelerates toward a brick wall, the trio can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with the pace and then they one by one break down in laughter. The track descends into unplugged slow bass plucks, the wreckage of an effort toward ambitious playing. Amid all the intentionally awkward and off-putting melodies squeaked and squeezed from guitar, bass, and drums, that moment is the first outward indication that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a stone-faced attempt at some lofty goal, like pushing the boundaries of guitar music or something. Instead, they pause and laugh, letting listeners who aren\xe2\x80\x99t already familiar with their occasionally goofy live shows know that their compositional efforts are as much a form of amusement for themselves as they are anything else. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to chuckle along with them.'"
b'Trevor de Brauw',7.3,b'Uptown',0,b'Rock',b'February 10 2017',"b'Trevor de Brauw is the guitarist for the stalwart instrumental rock band Pelican. His solo debut collects six open-ended, marvelously textured guitar instrumentals written during the last decade.'","b'For almost 20 years, the guitarist Trevor de Brauw has anchored the stalwart instrumental rock band Pelican. His chiseled riffs, stretching skyward from a crust of doom metal toward the wide skies of post-rock, have long been its real hook. As prolific as that band has been, de Brauw has kept busy with a litany of side-projects, too, from his new trio RLYR to the slow-motion creep of the drone collective Chord. Still, as late as last summer, de Brauw confessed to a lack of confidence in his guitar prowess, doubtful even of his ability to reproduce songs onstage. Making music, he said, was an emotional and mental necessity, not some chance to flex his technical abilities.' b'That compulsive approach is critical to Uptown, de Brauw\xe2\x80\x99s solo debut. Instead of serving as a\xc2\xa0showcase,\xc2\xa0Uptown instead collects six open-ended, marvelously textured guitar instrumentals written during the last decade. Sure, there is a certain level of wizardry here, especially with guitar loops that wrap into Moebius strips of sound or the army of ways de Brauw warps the signals from his six strings. During the record\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous finale, the twelve-minute beauty \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Black Soil Poetry and Song Sprang,\xe2\x80\x9d de Brauw manages to conjure and control a symphony of guitars by himself. The piece\xc2\xa0suggests the choir-like calm of Rhys Chatham\xe2\x80\x99s A Crimson Grail or Growing in its prime a decade ago.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s sophistication, too, in the ways that de Brauw patiently peels layers apart or puts them together. \xe2\x80\x9cDistinct Frequency\xe2\x80\x9d is little more than three minutes of a powerful drone and a broadcast of what might be the evening news, pitted against one another. But de Brauw pulls them apart so slowly that the music is dramatic and demanding, as if always on the verge of some major revelation. But Uptown is a subtle record, and both signals just fade into silence.' b'Indeed, the complexity and real delight of Uptown stem more from its commingled, nuanced emotions than its instrumental execution. These six songs are, alternately, messy webs of anxiety and comfort, frustration and hopefulness, fatigue and energy, together always pushing past simple binaries of happy or sad, light or dark. The deliberate chords of \xe2\x80\x9cThey Keep Bowing,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, seem at first caustic. But as they decay, they blossom into something beautiful, with individual notes suddenly circling above like halos.' b'Likewise, \xe2\x80\x9cTurn Up for What\xe2\x80\x9d (who said solo guitar records couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a sense of humor?) transitions from chimes and bells into a loud electric groan into, finally, a riff that aims for liftoff. The boundary between each phase is fuzzy, implying that each state is linked to the others. Like the intertwined loops and nested layers, there are no discrete or easy feelings to Uptown. It is, de Brauw says without a word, complicated.' b'The world of solo guitar records isn\xe2\x80\x99t really the domain of urgent, timely statements. They are, more often, practiced steps on a continuum, sometimes speaking only to like-minded practitioners and listeners. Despite its long gestation, though, Uptown feels surprisingly necessary and somehow reassuring. There\xe2\x80\x99s confusion and clarity within these songs, an understanding that these ideas and emotions only make sense in the presence of each other. During Uptown, the darkest parts sometimes allow for flickers of light, though other times the darkness swallows the light whole. It is an apt soundtrack for the start of 2017, then, when signs of pending apocalypse and revolution seem to bleed into one.'"

Their furious first album is\xc2\xa0slightly underwhelming.'","b'Agalloch\xe2\x80\x99s dissolution last year was a huge loss to bear, and only half of that has to do with how beloved the groundbreaking black metal group were. Vocalist/guitarist John Haughm was at the root of the breakup, something he\xe2\x80\x99ll own up to: he wanted to tour more than the rest of the band, especially guitarist Don Anderson, who chose to focus on his academic career. Haughm irked fans by referring to himself as a \xe2\x80\x9cvisionary,\xe2\x80\x9d not only committing the sin of Having an Ego (see: any time Kanye West makes headlines), but also marginalizing the contributions of his bandmates. Anderson was a key songwriter and brought much of the folk element to Agalloch. And Aesop Dekker, a powerhouse drummer who also plays key roles in VH\xc3\x96L and Worm Ouroboros, crucially filled out their live sound.' b'To his credit, Haughm realized he had to break away from the Agalloch name and start anew. His latest group, Pillorian, strips away some of Agalloch\xe2\x80\x99s neofolk influence and dives heavier into their black and dark metal roots. That he\xe2\x80\x99s rebuilding is obvious throughout their debut Obsidian Arc. For a less experienced band, the album would be a promising starting point. For someone of Haughm\xe2\x80\x99s caliber, it\xe2\x80\x99s slightly underwhelming.' b'Pillorian\xe2\x80\x99s strengths come from Agalloch\xe2\x80\x99s familiar comforts\xe2\x80\x94layered, sonorous riffs and tonal shifts as smooth as the guitars are heavy\xe2\x80\x94delivered with more immediacy. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the Light of a Black Sun\xe2\x80\x9d opens with the contrast of bright acoustic guitar and rolling metal waves that was a staple of 1999\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Pale Folklore\xc2\xa0and 2002\xe2\x80\x99sThe Mantle. The allure reigns brief, before succumbing to Haughm\xe2\x80\x99s torrents of fury, assisted by drummer Trevor Matthews and guitarist Stephen Parker. While there is another acoustic break towards the end of \xe2\x80\x9cSun,\xe2\x80\x9d the song sets the tone for the rest of the album, specifically its reliance on more metallic drivers and moods. Like Agalloch, Pillorian still finds a balance between soft and loud closer to their more progressive rock influences\xe2\x80\x94King Crimson and Genesis\xe2\x80\x99 artier takes and Rush\xe2\x80\x99s more hard-rock based brand\xe2\x80\x94than post-rock. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little more evident here, since Arc is Haughm\xe2\x80\x99s most \xe2\x80\x9cmetal\xe2\x80\x9d record thus far. Arc is far from breezy\xe2\x80\x94no interludes, no folky passages\xe2\x80\x94which clashes with Haughm\xe2\x80\x99s evident urgency to get it out there. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sentient Arcanum\xe2\x80\x9d is the exception, drawing up on Haughm\xe2\x80\x99s solo guitar ambient works, more Fennesz than Fleurety.' b'The rest of Arc is more furious, but no less majestic. \xe2\x80\x9cA Stygian Pyre\xe2\x80\x9d feels angrier than anything he\xe2\x80\x99s ever done, an example of spark and quickness working in his favor. Haughm has a knack for elevating black metal\xe2\x80\x99s fast-picked tremolos, revealing their symphonic potential. They are the fuel for Arc\xe2\x80\x99s momentum, especially in \xe2\x80\x9cSun\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPyre.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cArchanian Divinity\xe2\x80\x9d shows an affinity for Swedish black metal\xe2\x80\x94especially Watain\xe2\x80\x99s slower breaks and Dissection\xe2\x80\x99s frosty, florlorn atmosphere and blackening of classic metal melodies. Haughm is a living Jon N\xc3\xb6dtveidt without an accessory to murder charge, one who saw towering might in pushing the melodic pillars of Priest and Maiden to new heights.' b'While Agalloch existed in black metal\xe2\x80\x99s progressive wing, they were still a metal band, and thus understood the magic of a rapturous solo. Those moments are rare in Arc, which is its main problem. Haughm knows how to give his songs heft, but he\xe2\x80\x99s missing that lighter fluidity that complimented Agalloch\xe2\x80\x99s nature themes. One exception is \xe2\x80\x9cDark is the River of Man,\xe2\x80\x9d the closer, where those leads cut through the brooding atmosphere. It resembles Katatonia if they\xe2\x80\x99d honed in on their death/doom sound, instead of turning into goth AOR. \xe2\x80\x9cForged Iron Crucible\xe2\x80\x9d also features choral vocals that gleam at what made Agalloch great. Some more bursts of beauty like that would help.' b'Arc showcases Haughm\xe2\x80\x99s singular metal voice and commanding presence, but it also reveals what a group effort Agalloch was. Haughm is floundering without the right partners; it proves why his \xe2\x80\x9cvisionary\xe2\x80\x9d claim felt dubious. For any creative endeavor, a little self-assurance is necessary for survival. But no matter your skill, with a band, you can\xe2\x80\x99t go it alone.'"
b'Big Sean',6.3,b'I Decided.',0,b'Rap',b'February 9 2017',b'I Decided. attempts to bury Big Sean\xe2\x80\x99s wide\xc2\xa0mean streak and present the 28-year-old in a mature light.',"b'2015\xe2\x80\x99s Dark Sky Paradise was a massive and hard-earned leap forward for Big Sean. When pressed, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very good rapper, and the right selection of beats framed\xc2\xa0his words with a sense of new importance. The album was also unapologetically mean. Of course, its breakout hit was \xe2\x80\x9cI Don\xe2\x80\x99t Fuck With You,\xe2\x80\x9d but the same bitterness was applied across the LP to foes and exes alike. Perhaps no rapper is as obsessed with his own dick as Big Sean, and given the opportunity to brag and scorn, he found a comfort zone. I Decided. attempts to bury that mean streak, and present the 28-year-old in a mature light. In short: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work.' b'On I Decided., Sean continues to recount his come-up\xe2\x80\x94a banal narrative for a platinum-selling artist who\xe2\x80\x99s cracked the Top 5 with each album. The record\xe2\x80\x99s new twist is that Sean is quickly growing weary of fame and being in the public view. Bemoaning success is certainly a quick ticket\xc2\xa0to earn more success (see: Graham, Aubrey; West, Kanye), but Sean conveys no details or feelings to make his struggle compelling. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want [paper] if it can\xe2\x80\x99t change shit drastically, dramatically,\xe2\x80\x9d he claims on \xe2\x80\x9cHalfway Off the Balcony,\xe2\x80\x9d but there\xe2\x80\x99s no sense of\xc2\xa0what change he wants, and therefore nothing to connect to. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help that he still leans on forehead-slap lines like,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cEverything gold like I just practiced alchemy,\xe2\x80\x9d from the same song.' b'Sean also badly wants to show us that he is an album artist, not a singles rapper. \xe2\x80\x9cVoices in My Head / Stick to the Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d is a two-part would-be epic in which nothing of consequence happens. Over a spare, diffuse beat, he hears voices telling he \xe2\x80\x9ccould do better.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the always-powerful\xc2\xa0Metro Boomin tag appears, as does a captivating beat, and Sean runs down the various distractions in his life\xe2\x80\x94women, money, fame, \xe2\x80\x9cnegative energy,\xe2\x80\x9d etc.\xe2\x80\x94 but the undertone is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe plan\xe2\x80\x9d is making hits. In attempting to demonstrate how layered and complicated he is, Sean reaffirms what we already knew about him\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s better when rapping well-delivered nonsense over heavy beats.' b'And so the best moments remain the pop songs. \xe2\x80\x9cBounce Back\xe2\x80\x9d has already gone gold, and it sticks to the Dark Sky Paradise script as much as anything else on the new record. Sean does an honest-to-God Cartman impression\xc2\xa0on the song,\xc2\xa0suggesting that he\xe2\x80\x99s at his best when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take himself too seriously. The other single, \xe2\x80\x9cMoves,\xe2\x80\x9d is equally effective\xe2\x80\x94Sean\xe2\x80\x99s agile flow is his best weapon to distract you from his litany of clunkers, jokes about Jason Statham and Mini-Me and Channing Tatum all blurring together into a rubbery and enjoyable bounce.' b'On the album\xe2\x80\x99s best song, \xe2\x80\x9cSacrifices,\xe2\x80\x9d Sean raps, \xe2\x80\x9cI came a long way from that \xe2\x80\x98Marvin & Chardonnay.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Quite literally, it is a true statement: The Finally Famous single came out over five years ago, and like the rest of the world, Sean has had thousands of days to deal with life\xe2\x80\x99s quotidian pressures. But while he has\xc2\xa0become incrementally more skilled over the years, not much else has changed. Throughout I Decided., Sean conflates the passing of time with growth and progress. Nothing on I Decided., however, suggests that he has gained perspective worth sharing or to which he should devote a whole album. He continues to be a talented pop act attempting to be something he is not.'"
b'Elbow',7.1,b'Little Fictions',0,b'Rock',b'February 9 2017',"b""Elbow's latest deepens their formula\xe2\x80\x94rich, sweeping rock songs about melancholy\xc2\xa0and love\xe2\x80\x94with a dreamy sense of loss and time passing.""","b'Ever since 2008\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Mercury Prize-winning The Seldom Seen Kid, Elbow have offered\xc2\xa0slight tweaks on a\xc2\xa0reliable formula:\xc2\xa0meditative, dramatic rock songs, studded with sweeping\xc2\xa0orchestration and boasting subtly idiosyncratic songwriting. At this point, they may not win many more new fans stateside (or elsewhere), but as they age, they are settling into this groove, one that deepens slowly with more years passed and miles traveled.' b'Their last album, 2014\xe2\x80\x99s* The Take Off and Landing of Everything*, catalogued the mixture of life changes that come with adulthood, but was specifically shaped by the end of frontman Guy Garvey\xe2\x80\x99s long-term relationship with the writer Emma Jane Unsworth. An album blurred between places and times, it found Garvey writing from a place of increasingly crowded memory. Their new album\xc2\xa0*Little Fictions\xc2\xa0*picks up those threads, with a few more years behind them as touring musicians. Living that way has a certain effect: other people\xe2\x80\x99s live drift out of yours and seem to settle into place, while yours keeps rushing forward but also remains static in its own way, with you simply replacing old characters with new ones. Much of the album outlines love lost, love percolating, love maturing. And, as always, Garvey is a skilled chronicler of human interaction, offering a manifesto for the album in its penultimate title track: \xe2\x80\x9cWe protect our little fictions/Like it\xe2\x80\x99s all we are.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Unlike its predecessor\xe2\x80\x94where the weight of the past sometimes bogged down the tempos, too\xe2\x80\x94*Little Fictions\xc2\xa0*moves. Lead single and opening track \xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent (She Says)\xe2\x80\x9d rides on a nimble guitar figure and string arrangement. The drum pattern in \xe2\x80\x9cGentle Storm\xe2\x80\x9d wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel out of place in a club, were it not for the beautifully ruminative song that surrounds it. Though at their most insistent Elbow still mostly operate at \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful stride,\xe2\x80\x9d a song like \xe2\x80\x9cFirebrand & Angel\xe2\x80\x9d combines off-kilter elements to achieve a forward-momentum lurch.' b'Even at their most emotionally bombastic\xe2\x80\x94in huge orchestral sweeps like \xe2\x80\x9cOne Day Like This\xe2\x80\x9d or the slow-intensifying koan of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Take Off and Landing of Everything\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Elbow write songs with a careful architecture. And now, perhaps more so than ever, the affecting moments of their new material are rooted in very precise decisions, like the interplay of piano and percussion in \xe2\x80\x9cGentle Storm.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the most striking examples here is the vocal layering in \xe2\x80\x9cAll Disco\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cK2.\xe2\x80\x9d Abstracted, ghostly background vocals bubble in the background throughout \xe2\x80\x9cAll Disco\xe2\x80\x9d until they finally boil over and mingle with Garvey\xe2\x80\x99s, a manifestation of memory overtaking and reshaping your perception of the present. \xe2\x80\x9cK2,\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s highlight, pulls a similar trick. One long unhurried tumble (its verses and chorus elide together), it finds Garvey in a reverie, eager to unspool but doing so in many directions at once; the moments and places listed are far-flung. Throughout, his vocals echo themselves in the distance, slightly out-of-step with the main vocal performance. It\xe2\x80\x99s a watercolor representation of life passing and the experiences you collect, making the clarity of repeated lines like \xe2\x80\x9cOpens the fist just enough for a hand/To slip into the hand\xe2\x80\x9d hit harder.' b""*Little Fictions\xc2\xa0*is full of moments like this, where discrete flourishes yield quietly resounding payoffs. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to wish\xc2\xa0Elbow would let a different kind of intensity in\xe2\x80\x94that the storm wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always so gentle. But that's not really what Elbow do, and this many albums in, they know what they do well. They still excel in melancholic music about loss and love. But \xc2\xa0these days, wide-eyed wonder is always around the corner. \xe2\x80\x9cThen my telephone shakes into life I see your name,\xe2\x80\x9d Garvey sings towards the end of closer \xe2\x80\x9cKindling\xe2\x80\x9d (a song that plays like U2 in their lowest-key), before the repetition of \xe2\x80\x9cThen the wheat fields explode into gold either side of the train,\xe2\x80\x9d as the final lines of the album. In a different group\xe2\x80\x99s hands, it\xe2\x80\x99d all be too mawkish. But as Elbow settle into middle age, the additional wrinkles and whiskey stains only deepen the gravity of their stories."""
b'Matt Martians',6.0,b'The Drum Chord Theory',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'February 9 2017',"b'Matt Martians is the founding member and a driving force behind the band the Internet. His new solo record is full of slack, indolent funk.'","b'As a founding member and driving force behind the band the Internet, Matt Martians got better the old-fashioned way: album by album, the group tinkered and tightened and scraped away dust, gradually revealing their identity as an adept lite-funk outfit. Their third full-length, 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Ego Death, twinkled softly, but with enough clarity to earn a Grammy nomination and radio play. After all that hard work, Martians unwinds on his new solo record, The Drum Chord Theory, slackening the traditionally taut lines of funk and rap to make a droopy, indolent\xc2\xa0album.' b'This is music judiciously leached of urgency. Martians keeps verses short or excises them completely, so there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much of an opportunity to upshift into refrains, which mostly come in the form of repetitive chants or near-whispers. Sometimes the drums and bass are overlaid at odd angles, hinting at a \xe2\x80\x9990s hip-hop groove but splaying sideways rather than cohering into something clipped and commanding. After a few minutes of a vamp\xe2\x80\x94keys and rhythm section, maybe hand percussion and a stray guitar line\xe2\x80\x94the band tires and moves on to a new one, frequently within the same song.' b'The recumbent funk comes paired mostly with stories of romantic woe; a central riff may change, but the male-female disconnect remains paramount. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t read minds,\xe2\x80\x9d Martians laments, addressing any potential future partners who might be listening on \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Love Is.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe just want to know what the fuck you want\xe2\x80\x94is that hard?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I think I found the one, something always goes wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings a couple tracks later. But he continues his search, assuring a woman on the album\xe2\x80\x99s final bonus cut, \xe2\x80\x9cElevators,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthat girl from the dream was you.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""These feelings don't bloom into anguish; The Drum Chord Theory is dillydallying on lazy Sunday, with stormy Monday kept at safe remove. Martians lightens the mood by flying into a synthetic, \xe2\x80\x9cAlvin and the Chipmunks\xe2\x80\x9d register to undercut a possible commitment\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cif you were my girlfriend, I'd make you feel good\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and peppers songs with asides like the enthusiastic Internet endorsement that closes \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Are Yo Friends?\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cSyd, Chris, Steve, Pat, Jameel, I love y\xe2\x80\x99all niggas man,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, name checking bandmates. Then he adds happily, \xe2\x80\x9cBut everyone else man, if we ain\xe2\x80\x99t cool, then I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s meta-commentary, too: after a couple tunes reorganize around a different vamp at the halfway point, on \xe2\x80\x9cBabyGirl,\xe2\x80\x9d Martians quips \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t no hidden track back here\xe2\x80\x94next song.\xe2\x80\x9d Cue a track change."" b'If you won\xe2\x80\x99t come to The Drum Chord Theory for a bracing shot of adrenaline, supine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean unenjoyable. The more Martians sinks into his funk hammock, the better. On \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern Isolation,\xe2\x80\x9d the bass squirms up and down the scale, evoking Caetano Veloso\xe2\x80\x99s great \xe2\x80\x9cOlha O Menino,\xe2\x80\x9d while the singing washes back and forth, unhurried and opulent, like a sloop bobbing on the tide.\xc2\xa0Elsewhere, the band keeps sketching outlines and leaving them behind, dangling one riff, teasing it a bit, discarding it. Martians doesn\xe2\x80\x99t return to the rapturous, near nod-off state of \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern Isolation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The Drum Chord Theory is never unpleasant, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also never very distinct.'"
b'Emptyset',7.4,b'Borders',0,b'Electronic',b'February 9 2017',b'The Bristol-based electronic duo Emptyset are in a class by themselves when it comes to excavating brutality out of silence.',"b""By its own description, the Bristol-based electronic duo Emptyset makes music as a meta-study of the relationship between sound, surface, space, gear, and process. Given how freely Emptyset\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Purgas and James Ginzburg expound on those relationships in academic terms, you might expect the pair's work to drip with intellectualism. Between them, Purgas and Ginzburg actually do have academic backgrounds\xe2\x80\x94in art, design, and music. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that they\xe2\x80\x99ve turned to spaces such as London\xe2\x80\x99s Ambika P3 testing bunker for commissioned installation projects, and that such spaces have served as one of Emptyset\xe2\x80\x99s primary habitats over the project\xe2\x80\x99s 12-year history."" b'Taken on its own, however, Emptyset\xe2\x80\x99s music can be surprisingly single-minded. Borders, the band\xe2\x80\x99s fifth\xc2\xa0studio full-length (its first for Thrill Jockey following a string of releases for electronic labels like Subtext and Raster-Noton) can be boiled-down to three words: throbbing, bassy, sinister. More aggressive and pulse-driven than Emptyset\xe2\x80\x99s last studio album, 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Recur, Borders hits your senses with a brute force that belies Ginzburg and Purgas\xe2\x80\x99 conceptual approach to making sounds. The album opens with a flickering, short-lived wash of static that gets swallowed by a low-end thrum, a sound that pretty much persists from that point onwards until the final track concludes.' b'These repetitive bursts of bass-frequency shrapnel go through significant changes\xe2\x80\x94the timbre, layering, tempos, and intervals all morph\xc2\xa0from track to track\xe2\x80\x94but the central pattern and rhythmic attack remain constant as the pulses come one after another after another. And once the pattern shifts from album opener \xe2\x80\x9cBody\xe2\x80\x9d to a similar pattern on \xe2\x80\x9cBorder,\xe2\x80\x9d Purgas and Ginzburg establish relentless repetition as one of the album\xe2\x80\x99s primary features. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take long before Borders induces a meditative effect not unlike when you stare at ocean waves for long periods.' b'Likewise, the music on Borders suggests a comparable sense of catching finite slivers within a greater pool of endlessness. With a bandname derived from the mathematical term for \xe2\x80\x9ca set of elements containing nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that Emptyset aim to bring a sense of physicality to empty space\xe2\x80\x94or, as Ginzburg once put it, to identify the \xe2\x80\x9cthingness\xe2\x80\x9d at the heart of an empty void. When it comes excavating brutality out of silence, Emptyset sit in a class by themselves.' b""The album even comes close to tunefulness on \xe2\x80\x9cDissolve,\xe2\x80\x9d where an unidentifiable sound source takes on the character of delicate guitar strumming. \xc2\xa0And though you'd never mistake Emptyset for dance music, theirs is still body music, in a way. One can only imagine that listening to Borders with a heavy-duty subwoofer would be a punishing affair. Similarly, even without one iota of percussion\xe2\x80\x94Borders contains nothing by way of a traditional \xe2\x80\x9cbeat\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the groove is undeniable. And the new material, perhaps more than ever, harbors ample evidence for why Emptyset continue to identify as a techno act, albeit one whose style hews much closer to Berlin than Detroit. Given their Bristol background, it makes sense that Purgas and Ginzburg see their work as an extension of sound system/DJ culture."" b'In truth, Emptyset haven\xe2\x80\x99t evolved all that much since they began working in the full-length format in 2009. A microcosm of their overall progression, Borders essentially hovers in one mood, requires effort to recognize its contours, and ends on an anti-climactic note as the music simply ceases, without any sense of completion or finality. And whether it loses or gains flavor over multiple listens depends on the listener\xe2\x80\x99s patience threshold for repetition. But by turning up the volume and menace this time, Emptyset manage to put new spins on dubstep and industrial\xe2\x80\x94genres they don\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly reference\xe2\x80\x94as well. As such, Borders functions as a gateway between traditionalist dance forms and the artier end of the electronic-production universe. It also offers new ways of understanding both by reflecting each against the other.'"
b'Syd',8.1,b'Fin',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'February 8 2017',"b'Syd, the charismatic songwriter and performer at the center of R&B group the Internet, sounds more\xc2\xa0comfortable and focused than ever on her slinky, confident solo debut.'","b'For being such a breezy new voice, Syd\xe2\x80\x94the charismatic songwriter and performer at the center of R&B group the Internet\xe2\x80\x94is unleashing her debut solo album with a curiously resolute title: Fin. The artist, born Sydney Bennett in Los Angeles, is just\xc2\xa024, part of a loose kinship of musicians, like Frank Ocean and her brother Taco, who rode into public consciousness with Odd Future and Tyler, the Creator (much of Odd Future\xe2\x80\x99s early work was produced in Syd\xe2\x80\x99s home studio, at her parent\xe2\x80\x99s house). Though she and the Internet have released three albums together, it was the 2015 Ego Death\xc2\xa0that provided a breakthrough, gaining them a Grammy nomination and a certified smash in the Kaytranada-produced single \xe2\x80\x9cGirl.\xe2\x80\x9d Now she\xe2\x80\x99s trying it out on her own, with an album of twelve slick hits that are the best proof yet of what she is capable of as an artist. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t things just beginning?' b'Fin is, indeed, a fresh start. Stepping away momentarily from the Internet\xc2\xa0finds her as comfortable and focused as she\xe2\x80\x99s ever sounded. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my descent into the depth I want the band to get to,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the FADER last year. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, this is like an in-between thing\xe2\x80\x94maybe get a song on the radio, maybe make some money, have some new shit to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d Working with a variety of superstar producers, like MeLo-X and Hit-Boy, she leans on her different influences\xe2\x80\x94boastful hip-hop, hippie neo-soul, sensual R&B\xe2\x80\x94without ever losing the thread that ties them together: her inventive songwriting and magnetic personality, which leaps from the speakers every time she opens her mouth. Syd has perfected a pose, a slouching shrug and studied distance that makes her appealing, if a little remote. On Fin, it\xe2\x80\x99s better defined than it ever has been.' b'She uses this bemused vantage point to\xc2\xa0reinvigorate\xc2\xa0some R&B archetypes, inhabiting them and winking slightly at the same time. The opening number, \xe2\x80\x9cShake Em Off,\xe2\x80\x9d is all dirt-off-your-shoulders bravado: \xe2\x80\x9cYoung star in the making/Swear they sleeping on me\xe2\x80\x9d she sings casually. Track two is called \xe2\x80\x9cKnow,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is an Aaliyah bop, with Syd singing\xe2\x80\x94in the airiest part of her vocal register and over a sputtering beat\xe2\x80\x94about keeping a hook-up hidden away from the public. \xe2\x80\x9cGot Her Own\xe2\x80\x9d is a playful gay flip on the theme of loving a girl for her independence and ambition. On a quick sensual interlude called \xe2\x80\x9cDrown in It,\xe2\x80\x9d Syd sounds as proudly nasty as Ty Dolla $ign when she promises to \xe2\x80\x9cSwim in it/Dive in it/Drown in it/Hide in it, babe.\xe2\x80\x9d And there is \xe2\x80\x9cBody,\xe2\x80\x9d a minimalist moment that\xe2\x80\x99s sole aim seems to be uncomplicated sensuality; as she told Zane Lowe in a recent interview, she just wanted it to be the \xe2\x80\x9cbaby-making anthem of 2017.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0This is a demonstrably cool album, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hot when it needs to be, and gay listeners (like myself) will be psyched to have songs that are romantic and sexy but do not belabor the fact that they are sung from one woman to another, manifested by an artist who sounds entirely comfortable with her persona and talent.' b'On the final track, the revealingly titled \xe2\x80\x9cInsecurities,\xe2\x80\x9d she shows that there is, in fact, another side to her beneath the relaxed exterior: a woman who may sound self-assured, but who gets stuck in the same toxic bullshit that so many of us do, in this case a girl she loves with all her heart who can\xe2\x80\x99t return the favor. Here, she sounds a little beleaguered and hesitant, singing, at first, about packed suitcases but an inability to leave. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can thank my insecurities,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0she sings. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the reason I was down so long.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome omen that there\xe2\x80\x99s deeper psychological anxieties for her to explore on the next album, and I\xe2\x80\x99d love to hear more about that more vulnerable Syd. But by the end of the track, we\xe2\x80\x99re back to where we started, and the song ends with a stiff upper lip and a casual middle finger, melting into a pool of psychedelia.\xc2\xa0On Fin, what Syd seems to want to portray most of all is an admirable, inspirational confidence, a young woman singing and rapping while totally at ease with the beats that please her most.'"

This is\xc2\xa0their thing, and five albums in, they have it so down that it threatens to leave nothing to the imagination. Their fiercely beloved and unabashedly nostalgic dirtbag opus *On the Impossible Past challenged Celebration Rock\xc2\xa0*for 2012\xe2\x80\x99s most accurately titled album. Its follow-up led off with \xe2\x80\x9cI Don\xe2\x80\x99t Wanna Be an Asshole Anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0which emphatically slam-dunked its premise and left the rest of the dispirited\xc2\xa0*Rented World *to pick up the shattered backboard.

Can I hide these tattoos at my day job? Is playing Minor Threat on laptop speakers keeping it real or just lame? Am I too old to be sleeping on floors? Am I too old to be too broke to afford a hotel?' b'On first glance, single \xe2\x80\x9cLookers\xe2\x80\x9d plays too much to stereotype, name-dropping Dean and Sal, \xe2\x80\x9cJulie from the Wonder Bar\xe2\x80\x9d and a hook of \xe2\x80\x9cJersey girls are always total heartbreakers!\xe2\x80\x9d (also, lookers).

The Menzingers earn the benefit of the doubt when \xe2\x80\x9cThick as Thieves\xe2\x80\x9d opens with a sly skewering of the songwriting process (\xe2\x80\x9cI held up a liquor store/ Demanding topshelf metaphors\xe2\x80\x9d) and \xe2\x80\x9cTellin\xe2\x80\x99 Lies\xe2\x80\x9d hits on a point where the difference between 29 and 31 really does feel like an entire decade: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen buying marijuana makes you feel like a criminal / When your new friends take a joke too literal.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""But this is a Menzingers album, so the laughs are momentary and ultimately futile deflections of fear. The narrators in these songs are people racing through their 20s who\xc2\xa0find themselves trapped in tour vans\xc2\xa0or, most of the time, relationships they can't convince themselves they deserve. \xe2\x80\x9cMidwestern States\xe2\x80\x9d provides a gutting account of a codependent and deeply-in-love couple couch-surfing across the country, unsure of when things will ever be different as\xc2\xa0their options and prospects dwindle with each passing year."" b'The Menzingers\xe2\x80\x99 way with an anthem never fails them, even when the tough talkin\xe2\x80\x99 boyfriends on \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie\xe2\x80\x99s Army\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBad Catholics\xe2\x80\x9d lack definition beyond their bluster (\xe2\x80\x9cTo everyone you\xe2\x80\x99re such a sweet church girl/but I know your secret\xe2\x80\x9d), or the record\xe2\x80\x99s best melody searches for the rest of a proper song (\xe2\x80\x9cHouse on Fire\xe2\x80\x9d). *After the Party *might actually be *too *well-designed for jukeboxes, as the relentless, face-to-the-glass production results in the sad cowpoke shuffle of \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Mass\xe2\x80\x9d and the Meatloaf-inspired \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bars\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0clocking in at about the same volume as everything else, denying a dynamic range that\xe2\x80\x99s needed on a record that lives up to its title by sticking around one or two songs longer than it probably should.' b'At least it seems that way until \xe2\x80\x9cLivin\xe2\x80\x99 Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Easy.\xe2\x80\x9d The preceding title track could\xe2\x80\x99ve easily been an exit ramp for Menzingers, a wizened, hard-earned moment of contentment where a couple looks back on their drunken nights and wake-n-bakes to a new morning, confiding, \xe2\x80\x9cafter the party, it\xe2\x80\x99s me and you.\xe2\x80\x9d But on the very next song, singer Greg Barnett remembers the foreclosure sign in the yard and the empty bank account, and hits I-80 to another show that will surely be the start of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s debauchery. *After the Party,\xc2\xa0*though?

Described as an \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended\xc2\xa0country-life RPG,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0it\xc2\xa0is essentially a game about unplugging from the modern world and embracing the beauty of simple living. You, the customized character, quit your soul-sucking office job, move to\xc2\xa0an\xc2\xa0inherited farm, live off the land, and become a part of the small community in Pelican Town. You can get married and start a family, or just live alone with your farm animals. You can go on adventures. It\xe2\x80\x99s a story about escapism in a medium rooted in escapism, at a time when most everyone could use an escape once in awhile.' b'Among Stardew Valley\xe2\x80\x99s many fans is Jamison Isaak. The Canadian artist recently tweeted that playing the game has helped take his mind off the woes of the world, a small but important act of self-care. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not unlike the creation of his newest\xc2\xa0album as Teen Daze. When Isaak moved from the city of Abbotsford, British Columbia, to a more secluded part of the Fraser Valley, he began work on Themes for Dying Earth as a way of processing recent bouts of anxiety. The\xc2\xa0warm lullaby \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Rain\xe2\x80\x9d and its calming lilt operate like the soft-beating heart around which the record was built. In that way, Themes deals with harsh realities\xe2\x80\x94personal, environmental, social\xe2\x80\x94by seeking solace in nature. \xe2\x80\x9cDeep inside the woods is where I go to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadia Hulett sings on the downcast \xe2\x80\x9cLost,\xe2\x80\x9d as if inviting us to follow.' b""The appeal is irresistible, and once wrapped up in Themes, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine leaving its embrace. Isaak\xe2\x80\x99s music has come a long way from his earliest material, the pop-friendly electronic stuff known as chillwave, but these songs also take a step back from the live band setup explored on 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Morning World. Like any well-adjusted adult, Isaak has found a happy compromise here, creating a lush paradise with guitar amps and softsynths alike. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that he hasn't used his pop sensibilities and sensitive way with melody to conjure the idyllic before\xe2\x80\x94Themes is just a more fully formed, comprehensive utopia. From \xe2\x80\x9cCycle\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s gentle glide to the weightless \xe2\x80\x9cBreath,\xe2\x80\x9d an unbroken feeling of tenderness flows gracefully."" b'Such continuity comes down to the album\xe2\x80\x99s careful pacing, as winsome singalongs give way to fluttering ambience or uplifting instrumentals. Despite such a consistent, good-natured tone, Themes never grows stale or turns saccharine. A song like \xe2\x80\x9cWater in Heaven\xe2\x80\x9d has the solemn majesty of a hymn, while \xe2\x80\x9cCherry Blossoms\xe2\x80\x9d evokes the miniature splendor of M83\xe2\x80\x99s Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts. Isaak treats these lofty moments with the same care and attention as the more subdued ones, allowing the meditative \xe2\x80\x9cDream City\xe2\x80\x9d nearly five minutes to flutter and loop like a kite in the wind. When a pedal steel guitar shows up in \xe2\x80\x9cAnew,\xe2\x80\x9d its presence is strange, but it reveals an artist looking to color even the album\xe2\x80\x99s smallest corners.' b'Themes was recorded entirely within the Fraser Valley region. It was released on his own label, and each physical copy comes with a unique photo shot by the artist, which are said to showcase the local landscapes that inspired the music. It all makes for an exceptionally personal album from someone known for his intimate songwriting. And yet Themes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0subtle power is rooted in the dichotomy of someone running far from the madding crowd, only to open themselves to the world\xe2\x80\x99s problems and offer the comfort of a brief reprieve. For every smack in the face, Themes pauses, grins, and returns a kiss on the cheek.'"

There\xe2\x80\x99s an endearing simplicity to \xe2\x80\x9cFavorite Song,\xe2\x80\x9d inspired by Gallab\xe2\x80\x99s one-time side job as a DJ: \xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t you play my favorite song?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeats over and over.

b'Carsten Jost',7.0,b'Perishable Tactics',0,b'Electronic',b'February 8 2017',"b""Carsten Jost, co-founder of Hamburg's Dial Records, returns with his first proper LP in over\xc2\xa0a decade. The result is hypnotic, torn between cool remove and encroaching dread.""","b'Carsten Jost is a co-founder of Hamburg\xe2\x80\x99s Dial Records, a label responsible for minimalist classics from Lawrence, Efdemin, and Pantha du Prince, among others. Jost (aka David Lieske) released his debut album, You Don\xe2\x80\x99t Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows, way back in 2001, when Dial\xe2\x80\x99s favored strain of moody, minimalist house was still relatively novel; the deep house revival wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen for another decade. Since then, he\xe2\x80\x99s put out very little else, even as the style he helped establish has become ubiquitous in underground dance music, from the Smallville label\xe2\x80\x99s twinkly-eyed tone poems to the muted chords and buffed textures of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9clo-fi house\xe2\x80\x9d phenomenon.' b'Since 2007\xe2\x80\x94with three new Carsten Jost tracks that year, it was an uncharacteristically prolific period\xe2\x80\x94his output has slowed to a trickle: one song on Dial\xe2\x80\x99s *2010 *compilation; a split single with Lawrence in 2011; another compilation cut in 2015. Lieske put out a full-length with his duo Misanthrope CA last year, but that album\xe2\x80\x99s dissonant, doom-laden ambient is a long way from his ruminative and rhythmic sweet spot. Finally, however, the wind seems to have blown him back into the studio. The resulting album goes to the heart of the Dial aesthetic: wistful, hypnotic, and torn between ecstatic abandon, cool remove, and encroaching dread.' b'The bookending \xe2\x80\x9cIntro\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOutro\xe2\x80\x9d are stylistic outliers. Closer in spirit to Misanthrope CA, they combine ethereal orchestral samples with drifting synthesizers and distant scrapes and drones, suggesting Wolfgang Voigt\xe2\x80\x99s GAS project if Voigt had been brought up on a steady diet of Ligeti and doom metal. The album\xe2\x80\x99s nine remaining tracks proceed almost like a set of variations upon a theme. His grooves invariably emphasize the thud and hiss of classic Roland machines, and his crisp claps and flashing hi-hats cut through the swirling murk like searchlights. He likes his chords plaintive and his reverb trails long.' b'A few cuts are more melodic; the bittersweet \xe2\x80\x9cAtlantis II\xe2\x80\x9d features a bassline vaguely reminiscent of Ricardo Villalobos\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cDexter,\xe2\x80\x9d and its layered string pads are unabashedly sentimental. \xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d originally released on a split 12\xe2\x80\x9d in 2007, carves out a clean-lined counterpoint between Rhodes keys and a rich, tonal conga pattern. Mostly, though, he applies his layers of synthesizers like watercolors, and the blurred edges of his melodies seep outward like the outline of a stain.' b'Like much dance music, Perishable Tactics\xc2\xa0seldom gestures beyond its immediate environs; it\xe2\x80\x99s a music of immersion, of immediacy, and also of deep isolation. Whereas most dance music is social, Lieske spins his fibers into a soft, hermetic cocoon. But the occasional crack in the fa\xc3\xa7ade affords a glimpse of ideas not often found in conjunction with house music, beginning with the militaristic theme that runs through titles such as \xe2\x80\x9cArmy Green\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDawn Patrol,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the ominous cover photo of a shirtless figure crouching beneath a Mylar space blanket, clutching some kind of heavy weaponry. The theme becomes explicit on \xe2\x80\x9cPlatoon RLX,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a brief snippet of dialogue echoes in an incessant loop over mournful strings and a restless drum groove. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99d you get the nickname?\xe2\x80\x9d asks a voice; \xe2\x80\x9cThe killer?\xe2\x80\x9d whispers another in reply.' b'The clip comes from The World of Charlie Company, a 1970 documentary that the CBS News reporter John Laurence made while embedded with an American rifle company in Vietnam. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth bearing in mind that the Bob Dylan lyric that\xe2\x80\x99s quoted in the title of his debut album has a deeper historical significance: That line, from \xe2\x80\x9cSubterranean Homesick Blues,\xe2\x80\x9d inspired the name of the Weather Underground, colloquially known as the Weathermen, the \xe2\x80\x9960s radicals who took up arms against the U.S. government. With these echoes of the civil unrest and military disasters of last century, Lieske adds even more sinister\xc2\xa0overtones to his already unsettling atmospheres. As it happens, the Weathermen have recently been back in the news: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s shadowy right-hand man, cryptically shouted out the leftist revolutionaries in a 2010 speech. If Carsten Jost is a kind of dance-music Cassandra, complicating club music with some serious end-of-the-world vibes, Lieske couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have picked a more appropriate time to bring him back.'"

He\xe2\x80\x99s gazing ruefully across the same desolate, outer-Edinburgh moors that mirrored their youths in the original Trainspotting, where they bemoaned their lots as needle-pocked nihilists, subpar grifters, and residents of Scotland (not necessarily in that order). But really, he\xe2\x80\x99s breaking the fourth wall, all but short of winking into the camera and waggling a cigar, Groucho Marx-style\xe2\x80\x94because T2 knows exactly why its audience has returned, and what we want from it.' b'Happily, the film delivers: T2 rings true to the spirit of the original\xe2\x80\x94the grubby lad humor, the graphic wastrel extracurriculars, the creeping desperation of consciously inert lives\xe2\x80\x94with an unhurried fondness that still raises stakes for its heroes. (It\xe2\x80\x99s also not shy about embracing Trainspotting\xe2\x80\x99s most zeitgeist moments, slotting in copious footage from the original.) T2 is a best-case scenario for nostalgia, bowing to the diehards while squaring up to present\xe2\x80\x94and its soundtrack fares similarly, offering a loose-limbed mash of callback remixes and fervent young upstarts that echoes the glee of the original without laboring to eclipse it.' b'The 1996 Trainspotting soundtrack has been rightly celebrated for merging the Britpop bests of the era (Pulp, Elastica, Blur) with big-beat rave (Leftfield, Underworld). Championing dance music, especially in the power-ballad techno of Underworld\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBorn Slippy,\xe2\x80\x9d introduced it to new audiences while it was edging up from the underground stateside. Proto-punk was the other bloodline, Iggy Pop\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLust for Life\xe2\x80\x9d the de facto theme, all joyous and seductive id; the wistful, near-sarcastic flow of Lou Reed\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect Day,\xe2\x80\x9d under Renton\xe2\x80\x99s overdose scene, leant pathos.' b'T2\xe2\x80\x99s mix stokes these moments as merrily as Renton, Sick Boy, and Spud (poor, hapless Spud) slide back into degeneracy. Underworld debuts \xe2\x80\x9cSlow Slippy,\xe2\x80\x9d a canter update to \xe2\x80\x9cBorn Slippy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s sprint; splintered mutters replace the prior\xe2\x80\x99s yelps for \xe2\x80\x9clager lager lager lager,\xe2\x80\x9d but when those same gentle, sunrise synths nudge to the fore, they are a pensive homecoming. \xe2\x80\x9cLust for Life\xe2\x80\x9d gets a gnarled remix from the Prodigy, slicing a peppy group yelp between Pop\xe2\x80\x99s brays, though the scuzzy synth thrum tapers off into a curious shrug of a conclusion. Underworld\xe2\x80\x99s Rick Smith, T2\xe2\x80\x99s composer and soundtrack curator, also offers \xe2\x80\x9cEventually But (Spud\xe2\x80\x99s Letter to Gail),\xe2\x80\x9d a lovely, glacial runoff of an ambient ballad that folds in somber film dialogue; Blondie gets a return of sorts in \xe2\x80\x9cDreaming,\xe2\x80\x9d after their \xe2\x80\x9cAtomic\xe2\x80\x9d was covered by Sleeper in the original. (\xe2\x80\x9cPerfect Day\xe2\x80\x9d earns a piano reprise in the film that\xe2\x80\x99s not included here.)' b'T2\xe2\x80\x99s soundtrack doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just smack of the past, though; it gets a timely revamp alongside that seminal \xe2\x80\x9cchoose life\xe2\x80\x9d speech. Edinburgh\xe2\x80\x99s Young Fathers appear three times, magnetic in their scrappy ardor; despite winning the 2014 Mercury Prize for their debut, Dead, the Scottish-Liberian-Nigerian trio remain undersung for their high-velocity, socially astute experimental hip-hop. Director Danny Boyle has called their new track here, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly God Knows,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cBorn Slippy\xe2\x80\x9d-style \xe2\x80\x9cheartbeat\xe2\x80\x9d of T2; it shares that adrenaline, their own rough-and-tumble abandon (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly God knows that the people are cheating/Only God knows you don\xe2\x80\x99t need him\xe2\x80\x9d) merging smoothly with a gospel choir.' b'In fact, hip-hop\xe2\x80\x94absent from Trainspotting\xe2\x80\x94scores the best scene in T2. As Renton accidentally reunites with the homicidal Begbie in a club bathroom (one of T2\xe2\x80\x99s many winking callbacks to toilets), Jason Nevins\xe2\x80\x99 rattling remix of Run-D.M.C.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Like That\xe2\x80\x9d thumps with palpable humidity, unyielding in four-to-the-floor rigor. (The 1997 track, a UK hit at the time, feels singularly like a return to roots for Boyle; his last film soundtracks have been tempered affairs, anchored by Bob Dylan and the Maccabees, Moby and Unkle, and Bill Withers and A.R. Rahman.) Elsewhere, the Welsh drum\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99bass DJ High Contrast whips up a fatalistic film opener in \xe2\x80\x9cShotgun Mouthwash;\xe2\x80\x9d the acidic staccato mimics the drums of \xe2\x80\x9cLust for Life\xe2\x80\x9d and abets a series of fitting poor-bastard asides. (The bleakest: \xe2\x80\x9cLast night I dreamt I went to Woodstock but I only saw Sha-Na-Na.\xe2\x80\x9d) The dusky London shoegazers Wolf Alice, the British surf-rockers Fat White Family, and the bawdy Irish comedy duo the Rubberbandits round out the new class ably.' b'The success of T2\xe2\x80\x99s soundtrack, and the film itself, lies in its sense of contentment; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lobby to be seminal again. It\xe2\x80\x99s as exuberant as its predecessor, with some honest grit flaking against the more mannered sentimentality; it keeps a popular hearth warm and has a kicking, striving spine. To paraphrase an old friend: T2\xe2\x80\x99s still got a great fucking personality.'"
b'Porcelain Raft',6.7,b'Microclimate',0,b'Electronic',b'February 7 2017',"b""On his third full-length as Porcelain Raft, Mauro Remiddi continues to put out sumptuous dreampop that's easy to mistake as style over substance.""","b'Since he first started putting out solo singles as Porcelain Raft in 2010, former Sunny Day Sets Fire frontman Mauro Remiddi has built a career on an indie/electro/dreampop blend so smooth it often obscures his songwriting gifts. With Microclimate, his third Porcelain Raft full-length, Remiddi grows as a songwriter/arranger while refining the subtlety of his approach. Of course, the problem with subtlety is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly noticeable when you get better at it. So when you compare Microclimate to 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Half Awake EP, 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Permanent Signal, and his 2012 full-length debut Strange Weekend, Remiddi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be offering much of anything new.' b'Like those previous releases, the sense of space on Microclimate is so vast and full that it\xe2\x80\x99s as if Remiddi and\xc2\xa0mixing engineer Chris Coady meant for the music to be projected across a fluffy cloudscape that stretches for miles. The wide-angle scope of the music can sometimes engulf its central figure, especially as he\xc2\xa0relies more heavily on soft electronic beats and plush reverbs. On skittering numbers like \xe2\x80\x9cDistant Shore\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cKookaburra,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, Remiddi recaptures the vibe of \xe2\x80\x9cWest End Girls\xe2\x80\x9d-era Pet Shop Boys\xe2\x80\x94but it takes multiple listens to notice that he\xe2\x80\x99s managed to do so in his own image.' b'If, say, Remiddi dressed these tunes in stripped-down arrangements centered around piano or acoustic guitar (as he does at the beginning of \xe2\x80\x9cKookaburra\xe2\x80\x9d), the somewhat oddly-shaped relationship between his chord progressions and melodies would occupy center stage. Instead, you get songs like \xe2\x80\x9cRising,\xe2\x80\x9d where the quietly moving parts nearly\xc2\xa0drown in a kind of auditory soup.' b""On the other hand, wading through all the heavy layers of atmosphere to discern the song at the core of each track is one of Microclimate's rewards. Like the last two albums, Microclimate was heavily inspired by locale\xe2\x80\x94this time, the California desert. Remiddi has expressed both a romantic fascination for place and a sense of rootlessness in the past. Lyrically, the new material covers very little new ground with its airbrushed images of distant shores, breezes, trees. For a person who has worked as a circus musician and shaken hands with Kim Jong-un, Remiddi\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics don't disclose much. On \xe2\x80\x9cBig Sur,\xe2\x80\x9d he implores an unspecified person to come \xe2\x80\x9cto another world\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccome on come on come on this way.\xe2\x80\x9d At the end of the song, he reassures us that \xe2\x80\x9cbefore you know it/all the answers are on the way.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b""If the song asked more questions, perhaps the mystery of those answers would be more enticing. And when the album closes with the line \xe2\x80\x9cWe are falling... falling into the sun\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cZero Frames Per Second,\xe2\x80\x9d it would be nice to get a better sense for the kind of all-encompassing dissolution Remiddi wants to evoke. Nevertheless, as a pedal steel glimmers like setting sunlight reflecting over ocean waves on \xe2\x80\x9cBig Sur,\xe2\x80\x9d it's virtually impossible not to get nostalgic\xe2\x80\x94even if you've never been to Big Sur. The music on Microclimate can be so potently affecting that the lack of lyrical precision ceases to matter."" b'\xe2\x80\x9cMicroclimate\xe2\x80\x9d is the formal term for a set of climatic conditions that apply to a small ecosystem within a larger one. Remiddi chose the title as a way of signaling that he wanted each song to stand apart from the rest. Sure enough, each song pulls you into its own standalone \xe2\x80\x9cworld,\xe2\x80\x9d so to speak. But because Remiddi also sustains an ear-pleasing flow between those songs, it may take a few listens to recognize and appreciate what an artistic success Microclimate actually is.'"
b'Black Joe Lewis & the Honeybears',6.0,b'Backlash',0,b'Rock',b'February 7 2017',"b""Black Joe Lewis trawls the familiar intersection of blues, soul, funk, and garage rock, but he's got a few enlivening strategies to make the old formula feel fresh.""","b'Black Joe Lewis trawls the intersection of blues, soul, funk, and garage rock\xe2\x80\x94a well-traveled juncture. But he has a few strategies to make this timeworn mixture more tangy on his new album, Backlash. The first is vocal: Lewis can unleash\xc2\xa0a stirring scream, a cauterizing billow of noise that\xe2\x80\x99s sure to flutter your nervous system. The second is compositional: he likes shifting dynamics so that a slack song suddenly stiffens and lashes out, like a horse kicking an inconsiderate handler.' b'That scream, coupled with his heavy reliance on guitars, has earned Lewis comparisons to blues institutions (Muddy Waters), soul shouters (Wilson Pickett), and funk innovators (James Brown). But he prefers a different descriptor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all about putting on a good show and getting everyone having a good time,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0he said in 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no category for that other than rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 roll, as far as I know.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Lewis has shed collaborators and labels since releasing his full length debut, Tell \xe2\x80\x99Em What Your Name Is!, in 2009. After a pair of albums produced by Spoon\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Eno on Lost High Way records, he jumped to Vagrant and worked with an almost entirely different band for 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Electric Slave, while Stuart Sikes and John Congleton split duty behinds the boards. He\xe2\x80\x99s back with a similar crew this time\xe2\x80\x94Sikes produced the whole thing\xe2\x80\x94on InGrooves. It\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly three and a half years since the last record: his longest break as a recording artist, and maybe a sign that records don\xe2\x80\x99t matter much if your stage show is an effective good-times machine.' b'In truth, the changes between the second and third album didn\xe2\x80\x99t much alter the music coming out of your speakers, and the same rules apply to Backlash, where the foundation is still a selection of forms at most two degrees removed from the blues. When Lewis adds cement to the beat and irrigates his guitar with fuzz, there\xe2\x80\x99s an outline of the Sonics, or maybe the Black Keys. Snappy rhythms and bright, highly enunciated guitar leads put Lewis in the neighborhood of the New York soul revival labels Daptone and Truth & Soul. There\xe2\x80\x99s an \xe2\x80\x9cuh-ah\xe2\x80\x9d chant that might trace back to Sam Cooke\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cChain Gang\xe2\x80\x9d and female backing vocals that hint at the Sweet Inspirations.' b'You know this material well, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 stand-at-attention strategies come in. He tends to ratchet up the energy just as his songs are ending, like a driver who speeds up to red lights. On \xe2\x80\x9cGlobal,\xe2\x80\x9d he hits you with the first howl just to straighten your spine in the song\xe2\x80\x99s final minute, then wallops you with three of these in a row and adds another one low and far back in the mix for good measure. A comparable moment occurs during the bridge of \xe2\x80\x9cFreakin\xe2\x80\x99 Out,\xe2\x80\x9d where the guitar quivers with enough agitation to merit a song of its own.' b'On \xe2\x80\x9cPrison,\xe2\x80\x9d Lewis generously gives you a 40-second lump of the really rowdy stuff. After a solo, he realigns with his band, and together they clobber their way out of the song with scabrous, cutthroat riffs and a dollop of defiance from Lewis: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind being locked up!\xe2\x80\x9d But seconds later, the track comes to a close. It\xe2\x80\x99s thrilling and enervating at the same time\xe2\x80\x94Lewis gives the briefest glimpse of a supremely raucous affair, then shunts you out of a side door, all dressed up with nowhere to go.'"

He says\xc2\xa0Piano Song will be his final recording.'","b'After making at least 50 albums over the past three decades, pianist Matthew Shipp has decided that *Piano Song *is (probably) his final recording. So it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to hear it as a definitive statement, perhaps even a career summation. But really, every one of his records could be called definitive. His playing style is so inherently diverse and exploratory that he\xe2\x80\x99s almost incapable of making narrow-sounding music. Even when he sticks to a specific theme or format, his full array of stylistic weapons eventually gets deployed.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no explicit theme behind *Piano Song. *It\xe2\x80\x99s simply strong, well-considered jazz, with Shipp\xe2\x80\x99s piano leading a thorough dialogue with bassist Michael Bisio and drummer Newman Taylor Baker. In fact, the trio is so comfortably conversational it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to miss how much territory they cover, especially in the beginning. Opening with a slow, somber solo piece, Shipp guides his partners through subtle, subdued tracks that earn names like \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Desert\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSilence Of.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'But once the trio launches into \xe2\x80\x9cFlying Carpet,\xe2\x80\x9d with Shipp slamming out portentous chords and Baker pounding snare-bombs in response, Piano Song\xe2\x80\x99s relentless variety becomes crystal clear. The contrast between those heavy sounds and the tune\xe2\x80\x99s calmer passages is thrilling, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one the band revisits in numerous variations throughout the album. On \xe2\x80\x9cMind Space,\xe2\x80\x9d short stretches of quiet energy burst into raucous crescendos, while during \xe2\x80\x9cGravity Point\xe2\x80\x9d furious action cleverly cascades into reflective pauses. The trio can run\xc2\xa0full-throttle for entire tracks, too: In \xe2\x80\x9cMicrowave,\xe2\x80\x9d Shipp\xe2\x80\x99s note clusters twist around Bisio\xe2\x80\x99s stair-stepping bass without few\xc2\xa0gasps of\xc2\xa0breath.' b'The conversations in *Piano Song *feel ongoing, as if we\xe2\x80\x99re merely getting glimpses of a longer, potentially-endless\xc2\xa0back and forth. All three players have an abundance of things to say, and though there\xe2\x80\x99s sufficient space for each, no single recording could really encompass it all. That\xe2\x80\x99s true of most of Shipp\xe2\x80\x99s work, which makes\xc2\xa0his decision to leave the realm of recording disappointing but\xc2\xa0not entirely disheartening. He surely will keep conversing with his piano\xe2\x80\x94he has no plans to stop playing or performing\xe2\x80\x94and if the best venues for that might be something other than albums, he\xe2\x80\x99s earned the right to make that call. Just absorbing\xc2\xa0his discography could take lifetimes as it is, and *Piano Song *is another entry that will reward listening for a long time.'"
b'RAMZi',7.6,"b'Phobiza ""Noite"" Vol. 2'",0,b'Electronic',b'February 7 2017',"b'On the new\xc2\xa0EP from Canadian producer Phoeb\xc3\xa9 Guillemot, she\xc2\xa0presents tracks as travelogues and postcards from strange realms, suggestive of old\xc2\xa0Ethnic Folkways Library records.'","b'For the past five years, Canada\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Phoeb\xc3\xa9 Guillemot has been unobtrusively building up a peculiar little soundworld as RAMZi, mostly on small batch cassettes (now available on her Bandcamp page). But over\xc2\xa0the past few years, Guillemot\xe2\x80\x99s profile ticked upwards, with a release on the 1080p label, an eye-melting video, an art collaboration for RVNG Intl., and a full-length on Total Stasis (the label also responsible for Elysia Crampton\xe2\x80\x99s The Light That You Gave Me to See You). She quickly follows all that up with a tantalizing EP for the buzzing Mood Hut imprint. And the more of her music we become privy to, the weirder, wormier, and more immersive that little world becomes.' b'Guillemot\xe2\x80\x99s sound echoes trumpeter/composer Jon Hassell\xe2\x80\x94who, on a\xc2\xa01980 collaborative album with Brian Eno, called Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics, presented his notion of a \xe2\x80\x9cfourth world\xe2\x80\x9d to listeners. A mix of Western electronics and indigenous sounds, it\xc2\xa0drifted between minimalism, jazz, world music, and ambient, preferring the ether above them all. But Hassell\xe2\x80\x99s sound was exotic in much the same way as the painter Henri Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s jungle canvases were; they came not from globetrotting, but from introspective imaginings of other cultures. Guillemot is not alone in her ethnographic electronics, as a new generation of producers like Don\xe2\x80\x99t DJ and Andrew Pekler (as well as Oneohtrix Point Never) concoct pretend world rhythms and then twist them into curious new shapes.' b'RAMZi presents her tracks as travelogues and postcards from strange realms; the sleeve designs for last year\xe2\x80\x99s Phobiza Dia: Vol.1 and \xe2\x80\x9cNoite\xe2\x80\x9d Vol. 2 resembled old field recordings. Inside, Guillemot takes on aspects of Ethnic Folkways Library records\xe2\x80\x94foreign voices, animals sounding in the landscape, tribal drumming patterns\xe2\x80\x94and spins them through her circuitry.' b'As the album title playfully alludes, opener \xe2\x80\x9cFor Vanda\xe2\x80\x9d might be the sound of Ibiza right after sunset. Cricket sounds mingle\xc2\xa0with spring gurgles. A synth patch mimicking a bamboo flute echoes a kilometer away and a voice (maybe Guillemot\xe2\x80\x99s own) gets pitched down until it rumbles like a tribal elder. A hand drum enters, as resonant as a heavy stone splashed into a pond. As it all comes together and grows denser, it approximates the environmental moments of the Orb\xe2\x80\x99s Orbus Terrarum.' b'RAMZi\xe2\x80\x99s sounds are tangible and tactile, yet each piece feels slippery as river rocks. Guillemot\xe2\x80\x99s voice slides across \xe2\x80\x9cFuma\xe2\x80\x9d like a little cloud, and soon other altered voices arise and mix with it. With a grounding tabla pattern, \xe2\x80\x9cMessiah\xe2\x80\x9d is\xc2\xa0the most DJ-friendly track on the EP, but RAMZi still makes it feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s floating four inches off the ground. Her whispered exhalations get pitched up until it wavers like a broken spider web. Equally playful is when she slows down her vocals of \xe2\x80\x9cMale heya\xe2\x80\x9d until they resemble a wobbly AutoTuned hook. She then sets it against another gently dubbed out ecosystem, suggesting what Future backpacking through Hassell\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth World might sound like.'"

Not unlike Phil Elverum, she\xc2\xa0paints sublime, awestruck moments when simple things become overwhelming.'","b'There are two things you can\xe2\x80\x99t escape: the sky and yourself. It serves us, then, to understand both. Not Even Happiness, the pristine new album from singer-songwriter Julie Byrne, probes cosmic notions such as these with wonder and aplomb. Wanderer, dreamer, naturist, loner, romantic\xe2\x80\x94with her bold fingerpicking and deep voice, Byrne makes these well-worn identities feel newly alive. Not Even Happiness has all the lucidity and tactility of a healing crystal\xe2\x80\x94or more to the point, a rose quartz, the one that might help you to love.' b'Blending folk, new age, and silence, Not Even Happiness is a balm. In both sound and sensibility, it strives for clarity, that ultimate marker of enlightenment. Orchestral arrangements sit subtly in the mix; an occasional flute slides in, or a sample of crashing waves. Byrne solemnly charts the places she\xe2\x80\x99s seen\xe2\x80\x94Kansas, Arkansas, Montana, Wyoming\xe2\x80\x94and fills her lyrics with elemental things. She lies in a \xe2\x80\x9cverdant field,\xe2\x80\x9d catches \xe2\x80\x9cstars from a back porch,\xe2\x80\x9d watches a \xe2\x80\x9cdove over the prairie.\xe2\x80\x9d Her language is diffuse, braiding together themes of autonomy, desire, and struggle, but despite the heft\xc2\xa0of her poetry, the music exudes disarming ease. It feels much shorter than its 33 minutes. Not Even Happiness imagines a cross-section of Leonard Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s mysticism and\xc2\xa0Judee Sill\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability\xe2\x80\x94like the latter artist, Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s keen pop sense and stacked harmonies play out like wind carrying her along. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause they take themselves lightly, angels can fly,\xe2\x80\x9d the philosopher Alan Watts notes in his book Become What You Are, and Byrne seems to mind this idea sonically.' b'Byrne named her album* Not Even Happiness* because happiness, perhaps, is not always the point. There are virtues beyond happiness\xe2\x80\x94strength, wisdom, integrity, self-possession\xe2\x80\x94and Byrne honors these. Though she is a nomad, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t romanticize the position; her rootlessness sounds more like a calling, one that chose her, with sacrifices and doubts. \xe2\x80\x9cI have dragged my lives across the country/And wondered if travel led me anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d Byrne sings on \xe2\x80\x9cI Live Now As a Singer,\xe2\x80\x9d conjuring the sweep of This Mortal Coil\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSong to the Siren.\xe2\x80\x9d She sounds devoted to an inner compass only. On opener \xe2\x80\x9cFollow My Voice,\xe2\x80\x9d Byrne sings, \xe2\x80\x9cI was made for the green, made to be alone,\xe2\x80\x9d and she prioritizes her solitude with a sly turn: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been called heartbreaker/For doing justice to my own.\xe2\x80\x9d Not unlike Phil Elverum, Byrne paints sublime, awestruck moments when simple things become overwhelming. \xe2\x80\x9cWill I know a truer time/Than when I stood alone in the snow,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the moon was in the sky and shone.\xe2\x80\x9d Nearly a capella, she intones, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeking God within.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Despite this self-reliance, these are patently love songs, processing the unravelling of a heart sewn shut. The human heart is never easy in a Byrne song, though, by nature of its connection to an active human mind. Byrne knows the difference between solitude and loneliness, and she bears the lessons of the former while endeavoring the enormous task of navigating the latter with dignity. On \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Dove,\xe2\x80\x9d her tone evokes Gillian Welch, as she vividly paints her surroundings\xe2\x80\x94the woods, the endless river\xe2\x80\x94but sweetly admits to trailing off: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought of you so presently,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings. \xe2\x80\x9cI could not wait to tell you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Gleaming and steadied and wide, \xe2\x80\x9cSleepwalker\xe2\x80\x9d is Not Even Happiness\xe2\x80\x99 most gripping moment. It captures both the infatuated feeling of nascent love and how a dream of life can tempt you to lose control of your own. \xe2\x80\x9cI traveled only in service of my dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d Byrne sings, \xe2\x80\x9cI stood before them all/I was a sleepwalker.\xe2\x80\x9d Few contemporary songwriters earn a comparison to Angel Olsen, but in its acuity and grace\xe2\x80\x94what Leonard Cohen called \xe2\x80\x9cthat kind of balance with which you ride the chaos that you find around you\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Not Even Happiness makes a case for Byrne as one of them.' b'Throughout Not Even Happiness, Byrne sounds like a person who might worship the sky, but the majestic \xe2\x80\x9cNatural Blue\xe2\x80\x9d is a proper ode. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing particularly unusual about her tale of driving through familiar southwestern towns on tour, but her images evoke the life-affirming feeling of catching the exquisite light just so through a moving car window, while meditating on the changing scenery as it flickers by. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first saw you/That feeling, it came over me, too/Natural blue,\xe2\x80\x9d Byrne sings. Were \xe2\x80\x9cNatural Blue\xe2\x80\x9d released a decade ago, perhaps the poet Maggie Nelson would have found something in it to include in her 2009 prose-poem Bluets, a radiant reflection on the color. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was alive, I aimed to be a student not of longing but of light\xe2\x80\x9d goes Bluets\xe2\x80\x99 final sentence, and a similar logic guides Not Even Happiness, in which the most worthy wandering happens on roads within.'"

Performers on *Happy Together *include\xc2\xa0the multi-instrumentalists Zach Burba and Will Murdoch of iji (which Birgy has played\xc2\xa0in), Hand Habits guitar virtuoso Meg Duffy (seen recently on tour with Kevin Morby\xe2\x80\x99s band), and Big Thief\xe2\x80\x99s James Krivchenia (who also mixed and mastered the record), among others. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-sexual, Aquarian music,\xe2\x80\x9d Birgy once said, but rather than collapsing into some sort of Hair style free-love fest, Mega Bog\xe2\x80\x99s shape-shifting is carefully constructed.' b'Take \xe2\x80\x9cDiznee,\xe2\x80\x9d a swirling saxophone showcase that bobs along madly while spouting tongue-teasing lyrics like \xe2\x80\x9cSoda fountain on the fritz/In the ritzy/Underground Billy Goat bar.\xe2\x80\x9d The track is an absolute circus, always\xc2\xa0threatening to spin off its axis, if such a center even exists. The zippy\xc2\xa0dream that concludes \xe2\x80\x9cDiznee\xe2\x80\x9d flings Happy Together into a surrealism that is both sinister (\xe2\x80\x9cLondon\xe2\x80\x9d) and mystical (\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s History\xe2\x80\x9d), but like a disco ball, it always encourages dancing through the darkness.' b'This feels particularly pertinent on the haunted, interstellar \xe2\x80\x9c192014.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSo when it\xe2\x80\x99s your turn to start working towards the light/And how do you plan on giving me back any of my precious time?,\xe2\x80\x9d Birgy asks\xc2\xa0over spasming saxophones.

Its concerns are bodily\xc2\xa0as much as they are mental. Whether\xc2\xa0Happy Together is\xc2\xa0boogieing through a lively cacophony or laying low, Mega Bog never lose sight of the end goal: exploring purity and joy that take a variety of forms but never evaporate.'"

At his best, he still proves that simplicity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t equate to half-assery.'","b'When you hit play on The Universe and Me, \xe2\x80\x9cFuture Boy Today/Man of Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d begins as if the \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d button had been pressed just a hair too late. This creates the sensation that the listener is stumbling in on the music and reinforces the idea that it\xc2\xa0exists\xc2\xa0in a kind of perpetual flow independent of its recorded form. Of course, anyone who is already familiar with Tobin Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s m.o. won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. For decades now, Sprout and his longtime on/off collaborator, Guided By Voices leader Robert Pollard, have generated massive piles of songs that they\xe2\x80\x99ve presented as works in progress, parlaying shoeboxes of rough homemade cassette demos into remarkably durable careers.' b""Most known for his work as Guided By Voices\xe2\x80\x99 guitarist for two crucial runs during that band\xe2\x80\x99s long and storied history, Sprout has pretty much been the only additional songwriter GBV has ever had, and the closest to a Lennon-McCartney style foil for Pollard. The duo\xe2\x80\x99s shared sense that production values basically don't matter positions Sprout as one of the key pioneers of the early-\xe2\x80\x9990s lo-fi aesthetic alongside Sebadoh\xe2\x80\x99s Lou Barlow and Pavement founders Stephen Malkmus and Scott \xe2\x80\x9cSpiral Stairs\xe2\x80\x9d Kannberg."" b""Almost 30 years later, though, Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s dogged insistence on sticking to his original strategy casts him as the AC/DC of lo-fi rock. If you\xe2\x80\x99re still attached to the scratchiest Guided By Voices efforts that most bear Sprout's creative stamp\xe2\x80\x941993\xe2\x80\x99s Vampire on Titus, \xe2\x80\x9994\xe2\x80\x99s Bee Thousand, and \xe2\x80\x9995\xe2\x80\x99s *Alien Lanes\xe2\x80\x94*then The Universe and Me will likely hit you as both a bold reassertion by an artist saying \xe2\x80\x9cthis is who I am\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0and a sly step towards progress. If not, it will probably sound like more of the same."" b'Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s crude recording of piano, for example, drapes a cozy familiarity over the title track. The song\xe2\x80\x99s warm, pleasant ambience also prevents lines like \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take along my wings/So all my dreams can fly\xe2\x80\x9d from tipping over into maudlin confessional. On \xe2\x80\x9cA Walk Across the Human Bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d Sprout wears Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSuffragette City\xe2\x80\x9d on his sleeve as he offers a way for humankind to avert a future that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccarnaged all to waste.\xe2\x80\x9d The ever-economical Sprout devotes but two lines to the verse before introducing the main hook that repeats over and over. You can\xe2\x80\x99t listen without hearing Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s iconic line \xe2\x80\x9cwham-bam, thank you ma\xe2\x80\x99am\xe2\x80\x9d in your head, but you also can\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice that Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s head is in a totally different\xe2\x80\x94and strikingly current\xe2\x80\x94place.' b""At his best, he still proves that simplicity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t equate to half-assery. Still, despite his voluminous output, Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s solo work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always distinguish his style from Pollard\xe2\x80\x99s. If you\xe2\x80\x99re partial to Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s second tour of duty in GBV\xe2\x80\x94six relatively more developed albums spanning from 2010 to \xe2\x80\x9914\xe2\x80\x94it might be hard to shake the feeling of been-there-done-that as The Universe and Me unfolds in typically haphazard fashion.\xc2\xa0Some of Sprout's choices just come off as downright careless. \xe2\x80\x9cHonor Guard,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, begins with absentminded strums that start out of alignment with the rest of the song, snap into place, and then fall out of sync again\xe2\x80\x94over a drumbeat that\xe2\x80\x99s so unsteady it could have been played by a toddler. Such moves blunt the impact of Sprout\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics, which pop with personality and wisdom."" b'When an artist spends an entire career riding the line between resolve\xc2\xa0and stagnation, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to take them to task on not changing their tune. By this point, Sprout has made it perfectly clear what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give us each time. The thing is, The Universe and Me also gives us plenty of indication that Sprout is capable of more. Some minor touch-ups would have gone a long way. Had Sprout tightened a few loose screws here and there, it would have told us more about who he is now.'"

Oso Oso\xe2\x80\x99s second LP is\xc2\xa0advertised as an album *about *a mixtape, in the old rewind-and-record, Maxell-cassette sense. More accurately, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tribute to the emotional state of mixtape-making: being dumbstruck in love, or simply being dumbstruck by the concept of love, daydreaming the lifespan of an entire relationship and actualizing it within a span of 40 minutes."" b'For \xe2\x80\x9900s indie rock fans,* Yunahon Mixtape *can be heard as a seamless Since I Left You-style collage borne from college radio crate digging between 2001-2004.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a veritable Easter egg hunt for brisk, Barsuk-era Death Cab for Cutie melodies, and the appropriately titled and panoramic \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Big Beaches\xe2\x80\x9d stages\xc2\xa0a misty-eyed, full-hearted reshoot of \xe2\x80\x9cCath\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Elsewhere, Lilitri steps outside of classic emo to practice the fastidious, ship-in-a-bottle complexity of the Shins (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Secret Spot\xe2\x80\x9d), Built to Spill\xe2\x80\x99s anxious prog-pop (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bearer of the Truths\xe2\x80\x9d) and the walking-wounded blues\xc2\xa0of Spoon (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Slope\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'But prior to starting Oso Oso, Lilitri played as State Lines, a\xc2\xa0Long Island emo outfit\xc2\xa0that demonstrated an endearingly fervent\xc2\xa0dedication to bringing a certain kind of late-90s New York back in the 2010s. Oso Oso\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 debut\xc2\xa0sounded like someone trying to deconstruct pop-punk,*\xc2\xa0*but it appears in its purest form on *The Yunahon Mixtape, *as a secret weapon: when things threaten to get too fastidious on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Walk,\xe2\x80\x9d the second half breaks into a mad dash, while \xe2\x80\x9cShoes (The Sneaker Song)\xe2\x80\x9d follows \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Big Beaches\xe2\x80\x9d with a four-minute mile.' b'Lilitri is as much of a student of his influences as he is a fan, understanding the exact methods that make the sound of this music hit a certain way at a certain age and linger in the years to come. This is music that reflects a mood more often than it sets one, and the coherence of Oso Oso\xe2\x80\x99s influences allows the emotional tenor to shift wildly without upsetting the flow, from drumming up the confidence to act on a crush, putting feelings\xc2\xa0out in the open, and the subsequent vertigo of awaiting reciprocation.\xc2\xa0Lilitri played everything but drums here, and the stacked harmonies and call-and-response actually enhance its insularity in a meaningful way: most mixtapes are conceptualized long before they hit the reels.' b'Whereas State Lines or even the first Oso Oso album had the pinched sound of teen melodrama, *The Yunahon Mixtape *is pure romantic comedy: meet-cutes, playful misunderstandings, inside jokes and the acoustic midpoint where three minutes apart feels like an eternity. And like most entries in this realm,\xc2\xa0Yunahon allows itself clich\xc3\xa9 as an indulgence; the very first line plays on \xe2\x80\x9cfalling in love\xe2\x80\x9d as a physical pratfall and \xe2\x80\x9cShoes (The Sneaker Song)\xe2\x80\x9d proudly wields its uber-emo sentiments.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s enough acidity to keep it from getting too cloying, enough specifics to keep it grounded, enough humor to make everyone feel like co-conspirators playing hooky from realistic interactions. All of this makes *The Yunahon Mixtape *a realization of its ambitions and completely out of step on numerous fronts. It\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0understandable if the current state of affairs has completely sapped your ambition to have your head in the clouds, but damn if *The Yunahon Mixtape *doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a good argument for getting on Lilitri\xe2\x80\x99s level.'"
b'M. Lamar'b'Hunter Hunt-Hendrix',7.7,b'Funeral Doom Spiritual',0,b'Experimental',b'February 6 2017',"b'In this gripping song cycle, the vocalist-pianist M. Lamar pairs\xc2\xa0with Liturgy\xe2\x80\x99s Hunter Hunt-Hendrix to explore the tradition of African-American spirituals, mixing\xc2\xa0ideas from folk, opera, and metal.'","b'In the landmark 1963 book Blues People, a critic and poet then going by the name LeRoi Jones quoted some scholarly writing that placed the \xe2\x80\x9cblack Christian spiritual\xe2\x80\x9d in a tradition of African melody. He also described how songs created by American slaves were \xe2\x80\x9csuperficially modeled\xe2\x80\x9d on white hymns. Despite the mutual influences, Jones argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Negro\xe2\x80\x99s religious music was his original creation, and the spirituals themselves were probably the first completely native American music the slaves made.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Drawing a line toward 20th century popular music, Jones wrote that the blues \xe2\x80\x9cissued directly from the shout, and, of course, the spiritual.\xe2\x80\x9d But his more original claim concerned the way each new form reshaped the American mainstream, in turn. According to Jones, this phenomenon demanded of black artists a consistent reinvention of performance styles, in order to avoid the marketplace \xe2\x80\x9coverexposure\xe2\x80\x9d of past innovations.' b'With Funeral Doom Spiritual, the male soprano M. Lamar has pulled off another one of these stylistic escapes from all the previous, expected forms. And he has done so in a way that Jones might well have appreciated: by grabbing and juxtaposing vocal-production ideas from folk lamentation, European opera, and contemporary metal. This odd mix isn\xe2\x80\x99t the product of an ironic mindset. Lamar is clearly aware, and respectful, of more typical approaches to the African-American religious songbook\xe2\x80\x94including those by operatic sopranos. Though he also knows that exploration is part of the spiritual tradition, too.' b'Alongside electronic textures composed by Liturgy frontman Hunter Hunt-Hendrix, Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s vocals and pianism reframe the lyrics to some well-known numbers (such as \xe2\x80\x9cLay This Body Down\xe2\x80\x9d). And he ventures some new spirituals, as well. The hour-long song cycle is conceptually coherent and dramatically gripping\xe2\x80\x94especially when Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s singing moves between stark exhalations of doom and soprano lines that are full of vibrato.' b'The power of this shocking transition is communicated during the album\xe2\x80\x99s overture, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Demon Rising.\xe2\x80\x9d Early on in the track, Hunt-Hendrix\xe2\x80\x99s electronic part supplies steady percussive explosions that amount to a slow beat. Lamar pounds on the low end of a Bosendorfer piano, and sing-sighs in tones of gravelly menace. Then, as Lamar moves up the keyboard, his vocals swoop up in pitch, to the top of his range.' b'At this point, the singer-pianist still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t uttered a word. Though the work\xe2\x80\x99s emotional progression has been previewed: after starting from a vantage of bleakest desolation, a more beautiful resilience comes into view. But forgetfulness is not part of the journey. Even as it anticipates some form of rebirth, Funeral Doom Spiritual holds fast to an awareness of racial injustice and physical violence.' b'The lyrics\xe2\x80\x99 potency comes from their broad applicability, across American history. On early listens, I often wondered whether a refrain like \xe2\x80\x9cI carry your coffin on my back\xe2\x80\x9d was plucked from a vintage spiritual, or from a first-person lament related to a contemporary tragedy. The fact that the question can be asked justifies the pallor that hangs over the album, as well as the more abrasive textures in its electronic arrangement.' b'While the tempos and harmonies remain fairly static, the arrangements contain subtle shifts that make outsized impacts. On \xe2\x80\x9cThey Took You From Me,\xe2\x80\x9d as Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s voice rises to a peak of indignation (on the word \xe2\x80\x9cguilty\xe2\x80\x9d), the texture of Hunt-Hendrix\xe2\x80\x99s electronics undergoes a change. What was once a drone now becomes bell-like and sparkling\xe2\x80\x94akin to what might result if Oneohtrix Point Never were to interpret the music of Arvo P\xc3\xa4rt. The sense of release, here, works as an ideal sonic accompaniment for the catharsis embedded in Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, and his casting of a demon\xe2\x80\x99s curse.' b'Funeral Doom Spiritual also exists as a work for the stage. That ritualized production recently appeared at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Prototype festival, which focuses on new operas (both traditional and experimental in nature). When performed there, the piece featured a string section arranged by Hunt-Hendrix, in addition to Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s singer-pianist role. I thought it was a captivating show\xe2\x80\x94particularly given Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s post-apocalyptic, diva costuming. Still, some of the transitions between songs were ragged. On the album, a few of Hunt-Hendrix\xe2\x80\x99s string harmony ideas have been preserved, most noticeably on the electronic portion of the track \xe2\x80\x9cCarrying.\xe2\x80\x9d Overall, the studio recording\xe2\x80\x99s more consistent precision makes this version of Spiritual an ideal way to encounter Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s radical innovations.'"

Behind narrowed lids, her eyes glaze like camera lenses. The longer you stare into those enormous black pupils, the more adrift you begin to feel. Beneath two tombstone-shaped slabs of hair, she appraises us coldly, her expression unreadable.

The album followed suit. Trading the playful eclecticism of *Debut *and *Post *for distorted, hardscrabble electronic drums and warm, melancholy strings, it showcased a newly focused side of the musician while embracing all of her most provocative contradictions.' b""By 1997, when she released Homogenic, Bj\xc3\xb6rk had been a familiar face to pop fans for a decade. The Icelandic singer and composer had first appeared on many listeners\xe2\x80\x99 radars in 1987, when the Sugarcubes\xe2\x80\x99 surprise hit \xe2\x80\x9cBirthday\xe2\x80\x9d made actual stars out of a quintet whose entire raison d'\xc3\xaatre had been to lampoon pop. (Her countrymen, meanwhile, had been listening to her since 1977, when she recorded her debut album\xe2\x80\x94a collection of covers translated into Icelandic along with a few original songs, including an instrumental written by Bj\xc3\xb6rk herself\xe2\x80\x94 at the tender age of 11.)"" b'After a few whirlwind years with the band, she struck\xc2\xa0out on her own with 1993\xe2\x80\x99s Debut, enlisting Nellee Hooper of Soul II Soul and Massive Attack to co-produce the album. It was a clean break, trading the Sugarcubes\xe2\x80\x99 jangly alt-rock for the electronic sounds then coming out of the UK: house beats and basslines, trip-hop atmospheres, and the rippling textures of experimental techno, which she fleshed out with orchestral strings, big-band jazz, and a smattering of world music. Surprising even her record label, which scrambled to manufacture enough records to keep up with demand, it went all the way to No. 3 on the UK albums chart. On this side of the pond, some listeners were less thrilled with her new, electronic direction: Rolling Stone carped that Hooper had \xe2\x80\x9csabotaged a\nferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, \xe2\x80\x9cBj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s singular skills cry out for genuine band chemistry, and instead she gets Hooper\xe2\x80\x99s Euro art-school schlock.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""Bj\xc3\xb6rk paid no heed to critics (including fellow Sugarcube \xc3\x9e\xc3\xb3r Eldon, now also her ex-husband) who were dismissive of her burgeoning interest in electronic music. Moving from Iceland to London, she threw herself into UK dance music, soaking up its club culture and collaborating with 808 State\xe2\x80\x99s Graham Massey, Tricky, Howie B, and Talvin Singh, among others. She may have come to electronic music as an outsider, but she had good instincts: For remixes, she avoided the usual suspects in favor of some of the most adventurous artists on the scene: the Black Dog, Andrew Weatherall\xe2\x80\x99s Sabres of Paradise, the junglist Dillinja, even Mika Vainio, aka \xc3\x98, of Finland\xe2\x80\x99s scorched-earth analog noiseniks Pan Sonic. Today, the material gathered on her early remix collections\xe2\x80\x941996\xe2\x80\x99s *Telegram *and also the lesser-known, cleverly (if not at all succinctly) titled The Best Mixes From the Album Debut for All the People Who Don't Buy White-Labels\xe2\x80\x94holds up far better than the vast majority of remixes from that era, keenly balancing the songs\xe2\x80\x99 essences with a restless experimental spirit."" b'Part of that is because Bj\xc3\xb6rk never saw remixes as a simple marketing gimmick: Her youthful study of classical music had taught her to think of remixes as a contemporary iteration of the longstanding concept of theme-and-variations. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I think of that word remix, it\xe2\x80\x99s recycled, like trash,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Rolling Stone. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for me, the word remix means \xe2\x80\x98alternative version.\xe2\x80\x99 It is just another word\xe2\x80\xa6 for a variation. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Bach\xe2\x80\x94his symphonies were not completely written out so every time he played them, they would be different.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s unconventional instincts and her keen understanding of the hidden links between classical and experimental electronic music\xe2\x80\x94she had interviewed Stockhausen the year before, in fact\xe2\x80\x94guided her on Homogenic, as strange and uncompromising an album as pop music has produced. From the album\xe2\x80\x99s opening bars, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that she\xe2\x80\x99s on to something new. Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s approach to electronic music had never been conventional, but it had generally been tuneful, and her beats tended to keep one foot tapping in time to house music\xe2\x80\x99s reassuring thump. Not so \xe2\x80\x9cHunter,\xe2\x80\x9d which bobs atop fluttering, fibrillating kicks and snares, its reversed accordion glistening like an oil slick. Aphex Twin had toured as Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s opener after Post, and you can hear his rhythmic influence across the album: in the filtered breakbeats of \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xc3\xb3ga,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBachelorette,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c5 Years\xe2\x80\x9d; the resonant zaps of \xe2\x80\x9cAll Neon Like\xe2\x80\x9d; and the buzzing, headlong stomp of \xe2\x80\x9cPluto.\xe2\x80\x9d (The engineer Markus Dravs assisted in the beat-making, as did LFO\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Bell, who co-produced much of the album.) Throughout, drums crunch and sizzle, throwing up little clouds of dust with every impact. And with the exception of the relatively frictionless skip of \xe2\x80\x9cAlarm Call,\xe2\x80\x9d her beats are far more kinetic than most programmed rhythms, twitching and flexing like fistfuls of cellophane curling open.' b'After the stylistic zigzags of her first two albums, Bj\xc3\xb6rk was determined to create something more focused.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is more like one flavor,\xe2\x80\x9d she told SPIN of the album. \xe2\x80\x9cMe in one state of mind. One period of obsessions. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I called it Homogenic.\xe2\x80\x9d The working title, in fact, was Homogenous. The Icelandic String Octet, performing Eumir Deodato\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements along with string parts she had written herself, was the glue that held it all together. The result is a strange, captivating mix of impulses, with seesawing drones exploding into lush, neo-classical passages. You can hear the influence of the Estonian minimalist Arvo P\xc3\xa4rt, whom Bj\xc3\xb6rk had interviewed for the BBC the year before, on the slow, elegiac string harmonies of \xe2\x80\x9cUnravel\xe2\x80\x9d; conversely, the cut-up harp and strings of \xe2\x80\x9cAll Is Full of Love\xe2\x80\x9d faintly mimic the burbling pulses of Steve Reich\xe2\x80\x99s Music for 18 Musicians. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though my arrangements are quite experimental, I\xe2\x80\x99m very conservative when it comes to song structure,\xe2\x80\x9d she told SPIN. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s this beautiful relationship between complete discipline and complete freedom.""' b'Many artists have attempted to fuse dance music\xe2\x80\x99s rhythms with classical instrumentation; recently, between events like Ha\xc3\xa7ienda Classical (a pops take on the hallowed Manchester dance-music institution) and Pete Tong and the Heritage Orchestra\xe2\x80\x99s Ibiza Classics, the concept seems resurgent. But endeavors like those, and even Jeff Mills\xe2\x80\x99 more highbrow attempts at orchestral techno, nearly always fail; it turns out that DIY electronic dance music and classical orchestras, a format that has barely evolved in over 100 years, are largely incompatible. Bj\xc3\xb6rk succeeded where so many others have failed by weaving the two inextricably together into an undulating fabric as flexible and as durable as Kevlar, processing the strings until it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to tell where the silicon ends and the catgut begins. You can hear the influence she exerted upon a young Alejandro Ghersi, aka Arca, who would go on to collaborate with her on 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Vulnicura; his own music\xe2\x80\x99s viscous textures and mutating forms would be unthinkable without the example set by Homogenic.' b'Blanketing the album\xe2\x80\x99s electronic elements like a heavy layer of snow, Homogenic\xe2\x80\x99s strings give the album a somewhat monochrome palette; it\xe2\x80\x99s a dense listen, and in songs like \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xc3\xb3ga\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBachelorette\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of breathing room. But those rolling, subtly shaded contours periodically give way to jagged crags and extreme contrasts. This was not accidental: The album was meant as a kind of sound-portrait of her native Iceland. Bj\xc3\xb6rk envisioned beats \xe2\x80\x9clike rough volcanoes with soft moss growing all over it,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Markus Dravs, whose percussive sketches formed the rhythmic foundation for her songwriting. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted *Homogenic *to reflect where I\xe2\x80\x99m from, what I\xe2\x80\x99m about,\xe2\x80\x9d Bj\xc3\xb6rk told MTV. \xe2\x80\x9cImagine if there was Icelandic techno! Iceland is one of the youngest countries geographically\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s still in the making, so the sounds would be still in the making.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Many of Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s collaborators over the years have discussed her tendency to describe music in unusually synaesthetic terms: Despite her intensive formal schooling in music\xe2\x80\x94she began studying music at five, and was introduced to the work of modernist composers like Messiaen and Cage while still very young\xe2\x80\x94her studio vocabulary, when she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get a point across, leans toward terms like \xe2\x80\x9cmore angular\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpink and fluffy.\xe2\x80\x9d So it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly surprising that she would take formal inspiration from Iceland\xe2\x80\x99s steaming geysers, igneous formations, and other geological features that lend themselves especially well to the visceral textures and rhythms of late-\xe2\x80\x9990s electronica.' b'But there were also more personal reasons for her shift of focus.\xc2\xa0After years in London, she had become homesick for the land of her birth. She had traded a country with a population of fewer than 265,000 people for a city of some six million; not only that, she had been through hell and back in the years leading up to the album\xe2\x80\x99s creation. A string of relationships with high-profile artists\xe2\x80\x94the photographer Stephane Sednaoui, Tricky, jungle producer Goldie\xe2\x80\x94had all fizzled. A physical altercation with a journalist outside Bangkok\xe2\x80\x99s international airport had landed her in tabloids all around the world. And in September, 1996, a 21-year-old Miami pest control worker named Ricardo Lopez, furious about her relationship with Goldie\xe2\x80\x94unbeknownst to him, they had actually broken up just days before\xe2\x80\x94assembled a sulfuric acid bomb in a hollowed-out book and mailed it to Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s management before locking himself in his apartment, putting a loaded revolver in his mouth, and pulling the trigger, all in front of a video camera while Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Remember You\xe2\x80\x9d played in the background. Police managed to intercept the device with no further casualties, but Bj\xc3\xb6rk was left shaken\xe2\x80\x94concerned for her ability to protect those closest to her, including her son, and conflicted about her own openness with her fans. Returning to Iceland for the Christmas holidays, as she did every year, she fell under the island\xe2\x80\x99s sway. Inspired by the country\xe2\x80\x99s landscape, she became determined to make music that expressed a geological essence that was as raw as her own nerves.' b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to know any of these details to connect with Homogenic, however; its emotional impact far transcends the biographical footnotes of its making. Lyrically, the record picks up themes she had already explored on her previous two albums\xe2\x80\x94loneliness; sexual desire; desperate, even defiant love; the feeling of being a fish out of water\xe2\x80\x94but her writing is more vivid than ever before. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a fountain of blood/In the shape of a girl,\xe2\x80\x9d she bellows in \xe2\x80\x9cBachelorette,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a path of cinders/Burning under your feet.\xe2\x80\x9d The song is a kind of epic saga, and Bj\xc3\xb6rk has explained that it forms the third part of a loose trilogy with \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIsobel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a sort of Bildungsroman about Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s own adventures in the wider world.' b'Many lyrics take place as internal monologues grappling with her own contradictions. \xe2\x80\x9cHow Scandinavian of me!\xe2\x80\x9d she yelps on \xe2\x80\x9cHunter,\xe2\x80\x9d a desperate ode to self-empowerment, chiding herself for having believed she could \xe2\x80\x9corganize freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d (To Icelandic people, she later explained, Swedes and Danes are hopelessly regimented.) The distorted, minor-key \xe2\x80\x9c5 Years\xe2\x80\x9d is lovelorn and angry\xe2\x80\x94for anyone who has ever been stuck in a dysfunctional relationship, is there a more relatable lyric than \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t handle love\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x94while \xe2\x80\x9cImmature\xe2\x80\x9d channels broken-heartedness into a kind of empowering self-reprimand (\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I be so immature/To think he could replace/The missing elements in me?/How extremely lazy of me!\xe2\x80\x9d). Despite the self-flagellation, it\xe2\x80\x99s a quiet, tender song, with a beat carved out of a sigh; its twinkling arpeggios sound like a dry run for Vespertine.' b'When love turns up on this album, it is almost always something that is over or absent\xe2\x80\x94a missed signal, a sailed ship. But she makes real poetry out of these small, bitter tragedies, and she occasionally even finds hope in them. In the soft, delicate \xe2\x80\x9cUnravel,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings of her heart unraveling like a ball of yarn while her lover is away. The Devil promptly steals it: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll never return it/So when you come back/We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make new love,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, in a strangely affecting conceit about the fickleness and resilience of love.' b'But the main theme running through the album is the wish to rush headlong into a life lived to the fullest\xe2\x80\x94an unbridled yearning for the sublime. \xe2\x80\x9cState of emergency/Is where I want to be\xe2\x80\x9d she sings on \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xc3\xb3ga,\xe2\x80\x9d a song dedicated to her close friend and tour masseuse, in which churning breakbeats and slowly bowed strings mediate between lava flows and Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s own musculature\xe2\x80\x94a kind of Rosetta Stone linking geology and the heart. \xe2\x80\x9cAlarm Call,\xe2\x80\x9d the closest thing on the album to a club hit (the Alan Braxe and Ben Diamond remix, in fact, is a storming breakbeat house anthem) shouts down doubt with the indomitable line, \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t say no to hope/Can\xe2\x80\x99t say no to happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d as Bj\xc3\xb6rk professes her desire to climb a mountain \xe2\x80\x9cwith a radio and good batteries\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFree the human race/ From suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for catharsis, you won\xe2\x80\x99t find better than the album\xe2\x80\x99s final, three-song stretch: Following \xe2\x80\x9cAlarm Call\xe2\x80\x9d comes the incensed \xe2\x80\x9cPluto\xe2\x80\x9d:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me/But I just have to/Explode/Explode this body off me,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, launching into an ascending procession of wordless howls as buzzing synthesizers flash like emergency beacons. Finally, the quiet after the storm: The soft, beatless \xe2\x80\x9cAll Is Full of Love,\xe2\x80\x9d a downy bed of harp and processed strings. The title is self-explanatory, the lyrics wide-eyed, nearly liturgical. It is a song about ecstasy, about oneness, about infinite possibility\xe2\x80\x94and about letting go.' b'Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s voice is, without question, the life force of this music. You can hear her finding a new confidence on \xe2\x80\x9cUnravel\xe2\x80\x9d: The edge of her voice is as jagged as the lid of a tin can, her held tones as slick as black ice. A diligent student could try to transcribe her vocals the way jazz obsessives used to notate Charlie Parker\xe2\x80\x99s solos, and you\xe2\x80\x99d still come up short; the physical heft and malleability of her voice outstrips language.' b'Videos had long been an important part of Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s work, but they became especially crucial in building out the world of Homogenic. Compared to the sprawling list of collaborators on her first two records, she had pared down to a skeleton crew for this album; working with an array of different directors, though, allowed her to amplify her creative vision.' b'Chris Cunningham used \xe2\x80\x9cAll Is Full of Love\xe2\x80\x9d as the springboard for a tender, and erotic, look at robot love. Michel Gondry turned \xe2\x80\x9cBachelorette\xe2\x80\x9d into a meta-narrative about Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s own conflicted relationship with fame\xe2\x80\x94an epic saga turned into a set of Russian nesting dolls. Another Gondry video, for \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xc3\xb3ga,\xe2\x80\x9d used CGI\xc2\xa0to force apart tectonic plates and reveal the earth\xe2\x80\x99s glowing mantle below. At the end of the video, Bj\xc3\xb6rk stands on a rock promontory, prying open a hole in her chest\xe2\x80\x94a pre-echo of the vulvic opening she will wear on the cover of Vulnicura\xe2\x80\x94to reveal the Icelandic landscape dwelling inside her. In Paul White\xe2\x80\x99s video for \xe2\x80\x9cHunter,\xe2\x80\x9d a shaven-headed Bj\xc3\xb6rk sprouts strange, digital appendages, eventually turning into an armored polar bear, as she flutters her lids and wildly contorts her expression\xe2\x80\x94a vision of human emotion as liquid mercury.\xc2\xa0Her use of different versions of her songs for several of these videos also contributed to the idea that the work was larger than any one recording\xe2\x80\x94that these songs were boundless.' b'Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s initial idea for Homogenic was to be an unusual experiment in stereo panning. She imagined using just strings and beats and voice\xe2\x80\x94strings in the left channel, beats in the right channel, and the voice in the middle.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a genius idea: an interactive, self-remixable album, a sort of one-disc Zaireeka, that goes to the heart of the dichotomies that have always made Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x94theorist and dreamer, daughter of a hippie activist and a union electrician\xe2\x80\x94such a dynamic character. And while it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why the concept never came to fruition\xe2\x80\x94there\xe2\x80\x99s no way such a gimmick could have yielded an album as richly layered as Homogenic turned out to be\xe2\x80\x94it turns out to have been a prescient idea: the direct antecedent to Vulnicura Strings, which excised the drums and electronic elements of *Vulnicura *and focused on voice and strings alone.' b'In retrospect, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see the way that Homogenic paves the way for later career triumphs like Vespertine and Vulnicura: In its formal audacity and sustained emotional intensity, it represents a phase shift from *Debut *and Post, fine though they were. Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s personality has seen her seesaw between extremes throughout her catalog, and after the shadowy intensity of Homogenic, Vespertine would end up a softer, gentler record. (Bj\xc3\xb6rk has said that she envisions \xe2\x80\x9cAll Is Full of Love\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe first song on Vespertine.\xe2\x80\x9d) Created in the glow of her nascent relationship with Matthew Barney, it is the domestic album, the comfort album, the beach-house-weekend album. But *Homogenic *is the one that complicated the picture of Bj\xc3\xb6rk, that threw aside big-time sensuality in favor of more volatile forces, revealed a glimpse of her deepest self for the first time.'"
b'Various Artists',7.9,b'New Gen',0,,b'February 4 2017',"b'This 17-track compilation on XL Recordings offers\xc2\xa0a snapshot of the new generation of London\xe2\x80\x99s rappers, singers, and dancehall kings.'","b'You can find the beating heart of the U.K. rap underground online, somewhere among the thousands of kids desperately spitting bars on YouTube in hopes of getting noticed. On channels like SBTV, Link Up TV, and GRM Daily, no-name rappers spit (mostly written) rhymes for \xe2\x80\x9cfreestyle\xe2\x80\x9d competitions, battling for relevance in a digital Hunger Games for the chance to be anointed as the next Stormzy or Skepta.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s from this pool of hopefuls\xc2\xa0that New Gen was born; at first, as a showcase for promising talent stymied by London police\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive targeting of rap shows, and later as an Sunday afternoon radio show on Radar Radio. The latest incarnation is a compilation of original songs on XL Recordings, a 17-track album meant to be a snapshot of the new generation of London\xe2\x80\x99s rappers, singers, and dancehall kings. Grime is still the city\xe2\x80\x99s most famous urban musical export, but the youngest members of the U.K. scene seem less concerned with subgenre\xe2\x80\x94on New Gen, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear garage, dancehall, reggae, and R&B singers alongside the grime and hip-hop MCs, the lines bleeding between each without regard for the old guard\xe2\x80\x99s gatekeeping.' b""New Gen is the brainchild of Caroline SM, a GRM Daily editor that had found success breaking rappers on the site\xe2\x80\x99s YouTube channel. Barely in her 20s, she's worn many hats: editor (GRM Daily), host (NewGenRadio), A&R (XL Recordings), executive producer (the New Gen LP), and artist manager (Bonkaz and J Hus, who each signed to Sony in 2015 and 2016, respectively). As much as any of the New Gen rappers, she\xe2\x80\x99s carving her own role in the industry, with each gig feeding exposure and opportunity to the other, vertically integrating A&R, production, management and publicity under one brand. Though her sole appearance on the comp is to intro Kojey Radical\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFuck Your Feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d in effect, New Gen is her debut album."" b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s the producers that keep New Gen from simply being a collection of hard YouTube bars. Seeking to mimic the creative energy of production camps like Rick Rubin\xe2\x80\x99s Malibu retreat or Kanye\xe2\x80\x99s Hawaii sessions for My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Caroline SM and her fellow executive producer, the MC Renz, recruited Jevon, Nyge, and Soul\xc2\xa0to handle all the production duties, with artists popping in and out of different rooms at Red Bull\xe2\x80\x99s studios in London. The three manage to weave a handful of styles from hungry artists with varying dialects into a cohesive statement, from the sinister synths on the opening track (Avelino & Bonkaz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to the New Gen\xe2\x80\x9d) to bouncy R&B (Ray BLK\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBusy\xe2\x80\x9d), to a tasteful sample of Nina Simone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSinnerman\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cMan of the Hour\xe2\x80\x9d), somber King Krule-ish guitar tones (\xe2\x80\x9cLife Support\xe2\x80\x9d), or a dancehall spin on the Atlanta strip club sound (\xe2\x80\x9cMoney Haffi Mek\xe2\x80\x9d). It\xe2\x80\x99s no small feat.' b'Like a lot of U.K. hip-hop, New Gen may require a bit of lyrical decoding for an American audience; even if you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with the various Caribbean patois and know that \xe2\x80\x9cMoney Haffi Mek\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cmoney to be made,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of British slang that requires translation. Despite this, you might be able to deduce what AJ Tracey means when brags that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstill got these yatties up in my gaf,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cskengs in the rides\xe2\x80\x9d on 67\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cJackets\xe2\x80\x9d are weapons meant for nefarious purposes. The dialect may be different, but the tried-and-true topics of sex, haters, and violence are apparently universal.' b""Among all the artists featured on the compilation, Avelino & Bonkaz stand out as the most polished talents. Avelino, a 23-year-old from Tottenham, has three\xc2\xa0mixtapes and the EP F.Y.O. under his belt, while Bonkaz, the latest MC out of the South London town of Croydon (Krept and Konan, Stormzy, A2, Section Boys), is in the second year of a deal with Sony Music. Their tag-team on the LP\xe2\x80\x99s first track is an opening salvo, a two-minute barrage of lyrical punches that never quite gets topped: \xe2\x80\x9cA: Welcome to the New Gen/B: Funny how sometimes the new friends can be the real friends/A: You should mind your business, I know dragons in a few dens/B: It's like a whole family camping, them niggas too tense.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b'New Gen feels like a proof of concept\xe2\x80\x94that given the means and opportunity, these YouTube warriors can create work worthy of coming back to. For curious Americans who\xe2\x80\x99ve only just heard of Skepta and Stormzy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a preview of the artists in the London underground most likely to break through, cheesing at future MOBO Awards, taking down trophies (New Gen artists WSTRN & Abra Cadabra were already honored at the 2016 edition in November). And while a cynic might see New Gen as merely a reflection of Caroline SM and Renz\xe2\x80\x99s taste and grassroots network; an optimist might say it\xe2\x80\x99s an underground scene collectivizing for its mutual benefit. Nevertheless, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the more impressive collections of underground talent of late.'"
b'Mozzy',7.1,b'Fake Famous',0,b'Rap',b'February 4 2017',"b'The hard-bitten and prolific Sacramento rapper Mozzy shifts slightly to accessibility on his first album of 2017. YG, Jadakiss,and G-Eazy are featured.'","b'The title of Mozzy\xe2\x80\x99s latest album, Fake Famous, is ambiguous. The Sacramento rapper\xe2\x80\x99s star has certainly risen. He followed his prolific 2015 with an even more active 2016. YouTube hits for his\xc2\xa0music videos traffic in the millions. He\xe2\x80\x99s recently appeared on releases from E-40 and Rihanna favorite Boogie. And his first album of 2017, Fake Famous, features YG, Jadakiss, and actual pop star G-Eazy. So is Mozzy fake famous or just famous? Better yet, does he want to be? The album\xe2\x80\x99s compactness and consistency speak to Mozzy\xe2\x80\x99s pop sensibilities, but its heavy tones and themes suggest that he has more on his mind than stardom; maybe he just hopes to earn greater renown on his own terms.' b'Mozzy\xe2\x80\x99s greatest attribute is on full display throughout the record: He has one of the richest, most unique and elaborate vocabularies in all of hip-hop. His phrasing focuses\xc2\xa0details and brings out the poignancy in his words. A line like \xe2\x80\x9cI could get your flowers watered for a bronze Rollie\xe2\x80\x9d brilliantly emphasizes\xc2\xa0the outcomes of killing for gain, not the act. Later, on \xe2\x80\x9cGet Em,\xe2\x80\x9d Mozzy straightforwardly states that he could easily commit murder\xe2\x80\x94no help needed. His attitude in both cases is the same, but it shows the measured perspective of someone who has weighed the serious consequences of a brutal situation.' b'Gang activity and violence are consistent throughout Mozzy\xe2\x80\x99s work. Fake Famous is no exception, yet it still feels vital, which speaks to his ability as a storyteller and lyricist. Instead of providing an account with a beginning, middle, and end (\xc3\xa0 la \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Flockers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Art of Peer Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d), Mozzy tends to create micro-narratives within each song. He sometimes veers into generalities, but for the most part, he plucks out the right specifics to immerse the listener in any given moment. \xe2\x80\x9cBorrowed Time,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, stitches together admissions of a drug-addicted family with tales of driving away from cops. On \xe2\x80\x9cThe People Plan,\xe2\x80\x9d he ranges from the perils of the courtroom to the church days of his youth and back to the destructive system that breeds inequality.' b'Mozzy\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics are brought to life by his exceptional delivery and flow. His lines don\xe2\x80\x99t layer double entendres like\xc2\xa0Pusha T\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0or explode with vivid\xc2\xa0similes like\xc2\xa0Danny Brown\xe2\x80\x99s. They\xe2\x80\x99re remarkably colorful and elastic, though, full of sharp phrasing: \xe2\x80\x9cThrowing handles when I steer/Couple piglets in the rear/Watch the diamonds do they Dougie/I had to adjust the mirror.\xe2\x80\x9d He has a dexterity that works greatly to his benefit, but also his detriment: When nearly every line is high quality, and they connect seamlessly, few pop out.' b'Fake Famous does not aim to have a breakout single, but it is a relative shift toward accessibility for Mozzy. Ironically, the G-Eazy and YG-featuring \xe2\x80\x9cHold on Me\xe2\x80\x9d is lackluster compared to more effortless pop swings like \xe2\x80\x9cScorin.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, G-Eazy\xe2\x80\x99s slower, easier-to-follow verse highlights what Mozzy is unwilling (or unable) to do to cater to more casual fans: Let his foot off the gas. Of course, Mozzy is not trying to land on a song with Britney Spears. But particularly when he hands off hook duties (to Iamsu!, Lex Aura, and Bobby Luv), crossover potential is evident.\xc2\xa0F**ake Famous\xc2\xa0is the best he\xe2\x80\x99s done in translating his talents to a more conventional format. But Mozzy\xe2\x80\x99s mindset remains the same as ever: He\xe2\x80\x99s mired in a troubled past and present that define him. He may never be a superstar, but he is very close to what others could consider real fame. It seems to be his choice not to reach that so-called pinnacle.'"
b'Iron Reagan',6.7,b'Crossover Ministry',0,b'Metal',b'February 4 2017',"b'The third full-length\xc2\xa0from Richmond thrash metal crew Iron Reagan\xe2\x80\x94featuring members of Municipal Waste, Darkest Hour, and Cannabis Corpse\xe2\x80\x94is a compact vehicle for nihilistic escapism.'","b'Iron Reagan aren\xe2\x80\x99t your typical political provocateurs. Forget fighting the two-party system: The Richmond crew, whose lineup comprises members from latter-day crossover thrash groups such as Municipal Waste, Darkest Hour, and Cannabis Corpse, would rather throw a party\xc2\xa0of their own, shotgunning beers and riffs while Main Street burns. Iron Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s name may nod to punk\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding war with conservatism, but their music hardly resembles a call to legislative action. It\xe2\x80\x99s more of a drunken primal scream, the kind that issued forth from the throats of millions on Election Night as the Chyrons announced Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s stunning victory. (Not that the band were rooting for his opponent: a simple glance at their merch offerings reveals a disdain for authority on both sides of the aisle, Clinton included.) Activism can wait; for now, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to rage.' b'And that Iron Reagan do, on their new album Crossover Ministry. Like their first two records (2013\xe2\x80\x99s Worse Than Dead and the following year\xe2\x80\x99s The Tyranny Of Will), the band\xe2\x80\x99s latest effort doubles as a vehicle for violent, nihilistic escapism. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a compact one at that, clocking in at 18 tracks in 30 minutes. Songs like \xe2\x80\x9cA Dying World,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBlatant Violence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBleed the Fifth\xe2\x80\x9d retain the same shoot-from-the-hip paradigms that fans have come to expect. Frontman Tony Foresta shouts himself hoarse over chugging chords and snare-heavy backbeats before yielding to his Municipal Waste comrade Phillip \xe2\x80\x9cLand Phil\xe2\x80\x9d Hall for a free-wheeling solo.' b'The single\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDead With My Friends\xe2\x80\x9d is an exception, then\xe2\x80\x94an Anthrax-laced paean to whiling away humanity\xe2\x80\x99s final moments with good friends and cheap beer. And a few friends take turns at the mic as well. Screaming Females\xe2\x80\x99 Marissa Paternoster does some yelping on \xe2\x80\x9cEat Or Be Eaten,\xe2\x80\x9d and David Wood of straight edge hardcore greats Down to Nothing presides over the bludgeoning, 14-second \xe2\x80\x9cNo Sell.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Is this approach formulaic? Certainly. Does Crossover Ministry challenge the mores of its genre? Absolutely not. Of course, such is the DNA of thrash metal itself, not only as a descendant of hardcore punk\xe2\x80\x94a style similarly rooted in rudimentary parts\xe2\x80\x94but as the booze-soaked musical equivalent of the reptile brain, which could give two shits about intricacy or subtext. The id manifests most thrillingly (and hilariously) on \xe2\x80\x9cFuck the Neighbors,\xe2\x80\x9d which opens with the ring of a doorbell, followed by the entreatments of a dorky neighbor \xc3\xa0 la Ned Flanders, who asks the band to tone down the racket.\xc2\xa0Needless to say, Iron Reagan veto that request, eventually erupting in the song\xe2\x80\x99s sophomoric titular chant. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ideal anthem for left-wingers marooned in the Bible Belt, not to mention an apt sketch of our divided, pissed-off republic in the year 2016. But Iron Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0revolution runs on ribaldry.'"

The Last Artful, Dodgr certainly stands out in that regard: she\xe2\x80\x99s a queer black woman from Portland, Oregon\xe2\x80\x94not exactly a city known for its hip-hop scene. However, she also draws a great deal of inspiration from her hometown of Los Angeles, the nucleus of west coast rap. Growing up in the Midcity neighborhood, Dodgr had a front-row seat to the turmoil of the L.A. riots, a fact that she nods toward in her stage name: it\xe2\x80\x99s not just an L.A. Dodgers pun wrapped in a Dickens reference, it's also an allusion to dodging bullets."" b""Knowing this connection, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to hear echoes of the L.A. rap landscape in Dodgr's music: Kendrick\xe2\x80\x99s melodic moments, Vince Staples\xe2\x80\x99 barbed delivery, the sing-songy cadence of Boogie. Still, Dodgr\xe2\x80\x99s voice is a distinctive instrument, a sharp, nasal sound that she bends into a variety of shapes. More so than with her peers, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to draw a line between her\xc2\xa0rapping and singing\xe2\x80\x94in her hands, everything feels guided by a strong sense of melody. For her second full-length, Bone Music, she\xe2\x80\x99s partnered with Neill Von Tally, a Portland producer whose au courant beats draw a great deal of inspiration from the atmospheric moodiness of Noah \xe2\x80\x9c40\xe2\x80\x9d Shebib and Clams Casino."" b'Bone Music takes its name, at least in part, from the Soviet-era practice of bootlegging banned records using X-ray film. It\xe2\x80\x99s a timely reference to censorship, not to mention a fitting title for an album whose focus on the alienation of labor is near-Marxist. \xe2\x80\x9cAll you ought to do is work/Knee pad keep to the dirt/Mine all life long/Die young, then you die young,\xe2\x80\x9d Dodgr raps on \xe2\x80\x9cLLC"" before instructing, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I die, play my beats.\xe2\x80\x9d Even when she\'s stunting, her boasts are undercut by the realities of working-class life. \xe2\x80\x9cI made 24 dollars on my night shift...And I\xe2\x80\x99ma spend it all/Spend it all on me,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings on the lurching \xe2\x80\x9cBleu Replica,\xe2\x80\x9d wherein she tries to distract herself from a cheating lover by spending what little she\xe2\x80\x99s made at the club.' b'In the world of Bone Music, sex and death are the only escapes available from the daily grind; accordingly, more than a few of these songs focus on the former. Take the lead single \xe2\x80\x9cOofda,\xe2\x80\x9d an escapist bedroom jam (\xe2\x80\x9cSpoil ya baby/Explore your cravings\xe2\x80\x9d) cloaked in a darkly shimmering beat. The two-part \xe2\x80\x9cGood/Gravy\xe2\x80\x9d mines similar territory, segueing from a double-time rapping workout set to gated house synths to a back-half that sounds like the sparks thrown off by some futuristic machine. There\xe2\x80\x99s romantic tension here too, most notably on the airy \xe2\x80\x9cForeclosed,\xe2\x80\x9d which finds guest vocalist Natasha Kmeto playing Dodgr\xe2\x80\x99s yearning foil (a different version of the song, sung by Dodgr, appeared as \xe2\x80\x9cForeclosure\xe2\x80\x9d on last year\xe2\x80\x99s Fractures EP).' b'With Bone Music, The Last Artful, Dodgr assuredly steps into a lane that\xe2\x80\x99s hers alone. And while her perspective certainly sets her apart, she\xe2\x80\x99s hardly leaning on her identity here. Rather, Bone Music finds Dodgr extending her viewpoint into an exercise in broader, more allegorical storytelling. In an era where most rappers appeal to their listeners\xe2\x80\x99 aspirations, Dodgr aims instead for reliability, zooming in on harsh realities rather than well-heeled fantasies. It\xe2\x80\x99s an unusually grounded mindset for a promising young rapper, one that will likely serve her well as her profile rises.'"

It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a grand gesture\xe2\x80\x94just a way to get his sons away from the TV. Yet for Sampha, the youngest of five siblings, the instrument became a vessel for his personal growth. It helped enlighten the young boy, offering solace and purpose, commencing a spiritual journey that he\xe2\x80\x99s still navigating. In Sampha\xe2\x80\x99s world, the piano is one of the few things that\xe2\x80\x99s always been there. It\xe2\x80\x99s never gotten sick or faded away from disease. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would show me I had something some people call a soul,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings on \xe2\x80\x9c(No One Knows Me) Like the Piano,\xe2\x80\x9d a gorgeous ballad and one of many standouts from Process, Sampha\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable debut album.' b'The song\xe2\x80\x94much like the LP\xe2\x80\x94comes from a deeply meditative place, reflecting the innermost thoughts of a man still coping with heavy loss. His father, Joe, passed away from lung cancer in 1998. His mother, Binty Sisay, died of cancer in September 2015. Throughout the spare electro-soul of\xc2\xa0Process,\xc2\xa0you feel his mom\xe2\x80\x99s spirit in the stillness, pushing her son in his quest for understanding. Sampha\xe2\x80\x99s endured his own health struggles as well. He once discovered a lump in his throat while on tour; despite an endoscopy, doctors couldn\xe2\x80\x99t determine a cause.\xc2\xa0It\xc2\xa0became\xc2\xa0a catalyst for the singer to assess his own mortality here.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSleeping with my worries,\xe2\x80\x9d goes the\xc2\xa0opener \xe2\x80\x9cPlastic 100\xc2\xbaC,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know what that lump was.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Sampha\xe2\x80\x99s career dates back to 2010 and the release of Sundanza, his first EP. In 2011, Sampha was featured heavily on producer SBTRKT\xe2\x80\x99s debut album;\xc2\xa0his second EP, Dual, followed in 2013. Sampha played the background from there, turning up on tracks with Drake (\xe2\x80\x9cToo Much,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Motion\xe2\x80\x9d), Kanye West (\xe2\x80\x9cSaint Pablo\xe2\x80\x9d), Frank Ocean (\xe2\x80\x9cAlabama\xe2\x80\x9d), and Solange (\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Touch My Hair\xe2\x80\x9d). His\xc2\xa0presence was\xc2\xa0strong, even if his voice\xe2\x80\x94a gentle, shimmering falsetto\xe2\x80\x94added light touches to the scenery. Despite its delicate texture, Sampha\xe2\x80\x99s inflection hovers perfectly above the music, cracking at certain pitches to convey grief.' b'In a way, Process feels like a concept album on which Sampha rediscovers himself.\xc2\xa0The musician\xe2\x80\x99s mother was diagnosed with cancer the same year\xc2\xa0Sundaza\xc2\xa0came out, and as her primary caregiver, he naturally focused his attention on her well-being. Now, he\xe2\x80\x99s attempting to reconnect with his core while coping with despair.\xc2\xa0In the\xc2\xa0past, he\xe2\x80\x99d mix his voice to fit within the instrumental; on Process, he makes\xc2\xa0it the focal point.

On \xe2\x80\x9cUnder,\xe2\x80\x9d in particular, Sampha utilizes a sleek trap beat.' b'Even the album\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0most upbeat tracks are shaded with tension. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been with me since the cradle,\xe2\x80\x9d Sampha recalls on \xe2\x80\x9cKora Sings,\xe2\x80\x9d presumably referring to his mom. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been with me, you\xe2\x80\x99re my angel, please don\xe2\x80\x99t you disappear.\xe2\x80\x9d With \xe2\x80\x9cBlood on Me,\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s second single, the vocalist sings through heavy breaths, seemingly haunted by his own insecurities. It addresses the fear of moving forward after personal trauma, and for a quiet soul like Sampha, it also speaks to the panic of navigating the world by himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on this road now,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaims. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so alone now/Swerving out of control now.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'On album closer \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I Be?,\xe2\x80\x9d you feel Sampha\xe2\x80\x99s air of prolonged detachment.

b'Allison Crutchfield',7.8,b'Tourist in This Town',0,b'Rock',b'February 3 2017',"b'Allison Crutchfield\xe2\x80\x99s debut solo LP jettisons punky guitars for\xc2\xa0pirouetting synths, vast open spaces, and lyrics that explore haunted memories and still-fresh heartache.'","b'In 2014, between projects, Allison Crutchfield released Lean in to It, a synth-led EP of private epiphanies on love and heartbreak. From an artist given to collaboration\xe2\x80\x94not least with her sister, Waxahatchee\xe2\x80\x99s Katie Crutchfield\xe2\x80\x94its starkness was intriguing. Allison and Katie\xe2\x80\x99s first major outfit was Birmingham, Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s P.S. Eliot, a raucous pop-punk band whose busy\xc2\xa0lyrics and zipwire melodies seemed, in brief moments, to make the planet spin twice as fast. In 2012, a year after they split, Allison moved from drums to the mic with Swearin\xe2\x80\x99, still reveling in the racket of ferocious guitars. She began work on Tourist in This Town after Swearin\xe2\x80\x99 played their last show, in 2015, due to her split with co-songwriter Kyle Gilbride. After years touring with her sister and boyfriend, the 28-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Lean in to It follow-up\xe2\x80\x94and debut solo LP*\xe2\x80\x94*might have occasioned a reckoning with independence and her unmapped\xc2\xa0future. Instead, she finds her compasses jammed by existential drift and haunting\xc2\xa0memories.' b'As on Lean in to It, which corralled tales of youth romance gone awry, Tourist in This Town is a breakup record whose ennui goes beyond romance. Couched in her stories are trials of self-acceptance, psychic grappling, physical\xc2\xa0dislocation. Cleanly produced by Philly synth-whisperer Jeff Zeigler, the LP channels the kind of late-80s synth pop that jettisoned style in favor of vastness and grace\xe2\x80\x94skyline synths pirouette, vocals implore, pensive guitars sporadically erupt. The effect is to coalesce\xc2\xa0Crutchfield\xe2\x80\x99s anecdotes and soliloquies into a blur of fury and melancholy.' b'Like her sister, Crutchfield has a knack for sardonic observations designed to bore through the bullshit of young adulthood (mostly emanating from other young adults). With less room\xc2\xa0for stormy punk guitars, Tourist proceeds with a new lightness of touch. Instead of steel-plating her tongue, the music consoles and reveres the heart-on-sleeve lyrics. On \xe2\x80\x9cSightseeing,\xe2\x80\x9d as piano chords sprout\xc2\xa0reverb, Crutchfield recounts an awkward face-to-face encounter (\xe2\x80\x9cYou say nothing/You just come sit next to me\xe2\x80\x9d) in an anguished tone that suggests a divine experience. It\xe2\x80\x99s oddly dramatic, and a little jarring, but the lyrics\xe2\x80\x99 psychological layers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBaby, you are not as sad as you want me to think\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94somehow bring you to her level.' b'Rather than submit to the inevitability of breakups, Crutchfield obsessively autopsies what went wrong: she purports to be \xe2\x80\x9cselfish\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshallow,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunstable\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cBroad Daylight\xe2\x80\x9d; on \xe2\x80\x9cMile Away,\xe2\x80\x9d she seethes to her partner, \xe2\x80\x9cYou assume you understand because your voice is the loudest.\xe2\x80\x9d These scenes often occur in public\xe2\x80\x94waiters refill glasses, onlookers mock her tears. More than heated blow-outs, they sound like scrappy internal monologues, filling silences made unbearable\xc2\xa0by the weight and breadth of what\xe2\x80\x99s unsaid. On \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie,\xe2\x80\x9d Crutchfield and her partner inhabit a domestic space flooded with conflicting memories\xe2\x80\x94their touching pillow-talk, his yelling in her face. When she concludes, \xe2\x80\x9cYou bite me on my neck like I was something you could eat/You bite me \xe2\x80\x99cos you like the way I feel in your teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d her tone taints the cuteness with a dash of something sinister.' b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s a drawback to this psychic dredging, it\xe2\x80\x99s a slightly limited emotional range. Crutchfield frames scenes vividly, yet we rarely feel the weight of the mutual devastation, the perverse thrill of love discarded. When her post-romantic tumult subsides, on \xe2\x80\x9cExpatriate,\xe2\x80\x9d a moment of introspective honesty is warranted\xe2\x80\x94one that might carry more weight had the\xc2\xa0tone ventured further afield elsewhere. \xe2\x80\x9cThe things you used to hate about me are all heightened now,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, with a measure of contentment. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I love myself, or I\xe2\x80\x99m figuring out how.\xe2\x80\x9d The line still resonates, but it\xe2\x80\x99s more satisfying, in this case, to see her meticulous, anxiety-parsing work\xc2\xa0as its own redemption\xe2\x80\x94entombing the past in a reliquary of sad matters settled.'"
b'Homeshake',7.3,b'Fresh Air',0,b'Rock',b'February 3 2017',"b'Peter Sagar is a former\xc2\xa0guitarist for Mac DeMarco, and his charms are not dissimilar from DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s own. Here, he\xc2\xa0incorporates yacht rock and R&B tropes for a\xc2\xa0thrift store synth-pop sound.'","b'Since leaving Mac DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s touring band in 2013, Peter Sagar has been releasing music as Homeshake. His first two albums albums,\xc2\xa0In the Shower and Midnight Snack,\xc2\xa0were\xc2\xa0not terribly far\xc2\xa0from DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s own charm. They were endearing and melancholic,\xc2\xa0but also introspective and kind of gross. His sound was pleasantly ramshackle, born from groovy guitars, echo, and a lilting, almost bored singing voice.\xc2\xa0Sagar\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0music oozed a languorous, supine, stoned feeling, and he played the guitar as if\xc2\xa0it were a balloon animal: his riffs were\xc2\xa0elastic, contorted, and silly.' b'Overall, on those two records,\xc2\xa0Sagar\xe2\x80\x99s spin on slacker rock was easy listening, malleable and affecting in the way DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s rock was anthemic. Both Sagar and DeMarco\xc2\xa0sell\xc2\xa0versions of the world that you want to inhabit: devil may care, but anxiously millennial. And of all the musicians spawned from DeMarco\xe2\x80\x99s smokey den (Alex Calder and Walter TV among them), Sagar always seemed poised to be the one to breakout.' b'On his third album, Fresh Air, Sagar incorporates new tropes, including AM-radio yacht rock and quiet storm R&B, into his practice. He\xe2\x80\x99s incorporated the off-kilter guitar playing of\xc2\xa0his earlier work into his new sound, cleaved from cheap synthesizers and drum machines, and the result could be described as thrift store synthpop, or as it might have been called eight years ago: chillwave. Generally, this vibe suits Sagar. The architecture of his sound has always held\xc2\xa0some of the funniest parts of the \xe2\x80\x9980s at its core. And here, the pure sleaziness he is able to extract from his instruments can be gloriously campy, or unexpectedly elegant and morose. But he\xe2\x80\x99s also capable of laying down the cheese too thick.' b'In the album\xe2\x80\x99s title track, he pairs together white noise and funky guitars into an inexplicable but personable ballad of\xc2\xa0loneliness and stress. In the background, a faltering metronome chimes in, giving the song an even more broken down feel. On \xe2\x80\x9cCall Me Up\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEvery Single Thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Sagar adds\xc2\xa0unforgettably sugary synth riffs that are equally danceable and mopey. Yet, he also has a tendency to stretch his voice way past his range, sometimes with effects, or through plodding vocal gymnastics. If anything, his voice might be a big reason some of this music falls flat. On \xe2\x80\x9cTiming,\xe2\x80\x9d his voice is far too brittle to carry the mercurial beat.' b'But his aesthetic, for better or worse, has not veered too far from his earliest efforts. On early cassettes, and previous albums, the low-quality trappings of his recordings were\xc2\xa0appealing. Three albums in, it seems like Sagar still has some learning to do. All over Fresh Air\xc2\xa0lay old tropes: bursts of static, helium-inflected voices, scratchy sound, guitar noodling. The album also lacks cohesive pacing; its level of energy is low enough that it easily becomes background listening. While there isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite anyone who possesses Sagar\xe2\x80\x99s style in the wide world of indie rock, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to add a few more tricks, lest he fall into rote routine.'"

His soundtrack for the\xc2\xa01982 documentary Land of Look Behind could be called ambient reggae.'","b'Three years ago, RVNG Intl.\xe2\x80\x99s loving survey of Pacific Northwest musician Kerry Leimer revealed a contemplative player in the American late 70s/early 1980s underground who didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite slot into any one category or scene. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a punk, though he took a decidedly unlearned approach to music-making. And despite delving into synthesizers and ambient soundscapes, Leimer didn\xe2\x80\x99t really turn himself into a new age cottage industry. He even made twitchy, drum-heavy tracks as Savant, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite be considered a dance music producer either. In retrospect, Leimer seemed\xc2\xa0mostly like a one-man iteration of American kosmische music.' b'A sense of\xc2\xa0detachment from genres and scenes comes up again on this reissue of Leimer\xe2\x80\x99s long out-of-print soundtrack for Alan Greenberg\xe2\x80\x99s 1982 documentary, Land of Look Behind. Not readily available on streaming sites, the film is\xc2\xa0one to track down. It remains one of the most fascinating looks at the Rastafarian culture that begat Jamaican music, its eye trained on both the dense, tangled \xe2\x80\x9cbad land\xe2\x80\x9d of Cockpit Country as well as Kingston in the wake of Bob Marley\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. And while plenty of Jamaican music fills the film, Leimer\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the score expertly hovers between the island\xe2\x80\x99s ritualistic nyabinghi drumming and futuristic analog synthesizers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a soundtrack for a film that at times seems\xc2\xa0like a vague remembrance of a film itself, disassociating certain elements from the celluloid and imagining them in strange new ways.' b'Call it ambient reggae\xe2\x80\x94even if it\xe2\x80\x99s too fidgety to fully settle into either\xc2\xa0of those sounds. When the nyabinghi drums crop up, they\xe2\x80\x99re\xc2\xa0often background sounds rather than immediate thunder, adding\xc2\xa0just a subtle pulse to\xc2\xa0the sublime shimmer of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Outpost.\xe2\x80\x9d And when the drum circles move to the fore\xe2\x80\x94as on centerpiece \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cockpit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Leimer makes the ambient washes more ethereal, recalling\xc2\xa0some of Steve Roach\xe2\x80\x99s work with percussionists from the \xe2\x80\x9980s. On \xe2\x80\x9cConfusion in Belief,\xe2\x80\x9d sunburst synths entwine with tribal drums from the film, mixing with Leimer\xe2\x80\x99s keys and a battery of percussionists: Steve Fisk, Kevin Hodges, David and James Keller. At times, the sound anticipates Boards of Canada, with chunky drums, drifting chords, and\xc2\xa0voices swirling about, just at the verge intelligibility.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s rare to have vocals emerge in Leimer\xe2\x80\x99s work, so his way with looping, tweaking, and layering voices from the film into rhythmic counterpoint fascinates. Chant, casual chatter, an overheard conversation\xe2\x80\x94they all get minced into sound. A location recording of a crowd clamors in the distance on the post-punk landscape of \xe2\x80\x9cGun Court.\xe2\x80\x9d Leimer then samples\xc2\xa0a Jamaican voice discussing the bush and contorts it into all sorts of patterns on \xe2\x80\x9cTestimony and Honor.\xe2\x80\x9d He chops up that distinct patois and adds\xc2\xa0an array of handclaps, bird sounds, tapped hi-hats, and rewound tape atop it.' b'Three bonus tracks are tacked onto this reissue, though Leimer didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish them until many years later. Outside of an extended version of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cockpit,\xe2\x80\x9d they don\xe2\x80\x99t grapple with the coarse elements of Jamaica; Leimer instead emphasizes\xc2\xa0the piano and other acoustic sounds in his studio. In a decade that would see numerous artists engage in ethnic music and modern composition, from the likes of Jon Hassell to the Made to Measure series, the eight tracks of the original soundtrack remain unmatched in the decade. By turns raw and elegant, rhythmic and unearthly, Leimer\xe2\x80\x99s music evokes and retains the\xc2\xa0mystery of Jamaica itself.'"
b'Sleater-Kinney',8.3,b'Sleater-Kinney: Live in Paris',0,b'Rock',b'February 2 2017',"b'This live album, consisting mostly of late-career highlights, emphasizes what Sleater-Kinney does best: playing not just with urgent feeling, but in service of immense meaning.'","b'In the recently released video for \xe2\x80\x9cSurface Envy,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cstop Bush\xe2\x80\x9d sign in the background of one of the many live performances that comprise the clip. Written about their reunion after about eight years apart, \xe2\x80\x9cSurface Envy\xe2\x80\x9d is the story of Sleater-Kinney in that it is the story of bands\xe2\x80\x94groups of people, really\xe2\x80\x94that attempt to go against the grain: \xe2\x80\x9cWe win, we lose, only together do we break the rules,\xe2\x80\x9d goes the chorus. So while \xc2\xa0the No Cities to Love\xc2\xa0standout is not about \xe2\x80\x9cthe system\xe2\x80\x9d per se, it is one of the best fight songs they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever written\xe2\x80\x94a fact underscored by the pummeling version that appears on their new live album.' b'If there is one unifying thread among many of the songs that make the cut on Live in Paris, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that they\xe2\x80\x99re late-era Sleater-Kinney highlights (five of the 13 songs come from No Cities to Love, four from 2005\xe2\x80\x99s The Woods). From the post-recession terror of opening track \xe2\x80\x9cPrice Tag\xe2\x80\x9d to the sly sendup of capitalist femininity on closing song \xe2\x80\x9cModern Girl,\xe2\x80\x9d the tracklist emphasizes what Sleater-Kinney does best: playing not just with urgent feeling, but in service of immense meaning. Corin Tucker, Carrie Brownstein, and Janet Weiss came back swinging in 2015 as strongly as they ever had\xe2\x80\x94a gift considering how rarely it happens in rock. *Live in Paris *is the victory lap leaving us wanting more.' b'The setlists for S-K\xe2\x80\x99s comeback tour throughout 2015 were maximized to show the band\xe2\x80\x99s power after the better part of a decade away, and Live in Paris\xe2\x80\x94recorded at the historic venue La Cigale about a month into the trek\xe2\x80\x94has enough of it to make anthems out of lesser S-K songs. Girl-gang harmonies originally made One Beat\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d sound delightfully bratty, but Tucker\xe2\x80\x99s exaggerated vocals on the chorus resemble a demented Mickey Mouse; it\xe2\x80\x99ll stick with you like a childhood trip to Orlando. Old live footage suggests she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always sang it so idiosyncratically, which can be said of numerous vocal takes here from both Tucker and Brownstein. \xc2\xa0The latter\xe2\x80\x99s blood-curdling bird squawks on \xe2\x80\x9cI Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\xe2\x80\x9d will make you A.) wonder why Carrie Brownstein hasn\xe2\x80\x99t formed some avant-garde metal band for the sole purpose of squawk-singing (could also work as a \xe2\x80\x9cPortlandia\xe2\x80\x9d sketch); B.) love it even more.' b""Listening to Brownstein and Tucker sing together now, 20+ years after Sleater-Kinney\xe2\x80\x99s founding, you can hear how their voices have changed. On early Sleater-Kinney records, their vocals often recklessly (and joyfully) clashed, like a pit of dance-punks tossing their bodies at one another. These days, it's more common that their voices fall into worn, soulful grooves when they harmonize, like in the chorus of No Cities\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cA New Wave\xe2\x80\x9d; Tucker hoists her voice up above Brownstein\xe2\x80\x99s like she\xe2\x80\x99s casually hopping out of a pool."" b""The obvious downside of being a band with serious history is that fans who prefer the old stuff are probably always going to be a given. Sleater-Kinney toured around the January 2015 release of eighth LP No Cities to Love, so clearly those songs were prized. It was an excellent album, but S-K also played older fan favorites like \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re No Rock n\xe2\x80\x99 Roll Fun,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWords and Guitar,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Babies\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the tour and they don\xe2\x80\x99t end up here. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only real downside to what is surprisingly the first live album from a touring rock band that remains one of America's best."" b""Sleater-Kinney\xe2\x80\x99s existence as, in their own mocking words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe girl band\xe2\x80\x9d may seem less revolutionary now than it did on the other side of their hiatus, but it\xe2\x80\x99s partially because S-K helped pave a way for the women who now lead indie rock. In this sense, their presence is inherently political, even when they\xe2\x80\x99re playing a characteristically Corin love song like \xe2\x80\x9cTurn It On.\xe2\x80\x9d With that and with our current world in mind, *Live in Paris *makes an inspiring mixtape for the various battles at hand.

b'Strawberry Switchblade',7.0,b'1982 4-Piece Demo',0,b'Rock',b'February 2 2017',"b'In the early 1980s, the Glasgow pop duo Strawberry Switchblade were a band with many possible futures. This raw three-song demo catches a glimpse of the group they could have become.'","b'The story of Strawberry Switchblade is a reminder of just how small the alternative music scene was in the early 1980s, and how deeply its subcultures intertwined. Formed in 1980 in Glasgow by Jill Bryson and Rose McDowall, the pair\xe2\x80\x99s eye-catching look\xe2\x80\x94gothic Geisha in polka dot dresses and black lace gloves\xe2\x80\x94set them apart from their immediate peers, the buttoned-up young men of the Postcard Records scene. Their early live performances caught the attention of John Peel, for whom they recorded a BBC session. But with renegade A&R man Bill Drummond\xe2\x80\x94later to form pop terrorists the KLF\xe2\x80\x94installed as the group\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Strawberry Switchblade turned to face the mainstream.' b'Their 1984 single \xe2\x80\x9cSince Yesterday\xe2\x80\x9d was a breezily nostalgic electronic pop song that McDowall later claimed was about nuclear war. It broached the UK Top 10, propelled the duo onto the cover of Smash Hits, and made them officially big in Japan\xe2\x80\x94screaming fans, limousines, the works. Strawberry Switchblade split acrimoniously two years later. By now, though, McDowall was a face on the post-industrial scene, singing with Psychic TV, Coil, and the neofolk groups Current 93 and Death in June. She was also hanging out with a young Bj\xc3\xb6rk, then part of Icelandic anarcho-punk band\xc2\xa0Kukl.' b'For a group that lasted just one album, this is a long and tangled history, and one that Glasgow label Night School have made it their task to unknot. In 2015, Night School released McDowall\xe2\x80\x99s lost post-Switchblade LP Cut With the Cake Knife**, and they\xc2\xa0follow now with this\xe2\x80\x94a seven-inch of previously unreleased music from Switchblade\xe2\x80\x99s earliest days.\xc2\xa04-Piece Demo lines up three songs in 10 minutes, and it passes quick. Captured while the group was briefly a quartet, completed by bassist Janice Goodlett and drummer Carole McGowan, this recording captures a Strawberry Switchblade only hinted at by their existing recordings: a cutie garage group hiding something desperate and nihilistic beneath their gently shambolic exterior.' b'The sweet-savage juxtaposition of Strawberry Switchblade\xe2\x80\x99s name found echo in their music. Bryson and McDowall wrote songs that sounded winsome and naive, but spoke of an emotional desolation that was anything but contrived. In interviews, McDowall has spoken of her hard-knock upbringing in a Glasgow sink estate, where violence was rife and she watched her six-year-old brother die following a beating. Bryson, meanwhile, suffered from extreme agoraphobia, writing about her condition on Strawberry Switchblade\xe2\x80\x99s debut single \xe2\x80\x9cTrees and Flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d The version here, pared down to droning guitar and clumpy drums, is some of the sweetest fear and loathing that you ever heard. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate the trees/And I hate the flowers/And I hate the buildings/And the way they tower over me,\xe2\x80\x9d sings McDowall. The song closes with a lament: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t you see/I get so frightened/No one else seems frightened/Only me, only me\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d' b'One song here is wholly new. With its hopscotch rhythms, keening harmonies, and squirming bass, \xe2\x80\x9cSpanish Song (Don\xe2\x80\x99t Go)\xe2\x80\x9d would sound like textbook C86 were it not for the mariachi guitar outro that starts out halting and ends close to joyous. Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cGo Away\xe2\x80\x9d offers another glimpse of how Strawberry Switchblade\xe2\x80\x99s debut album might have sounded. The version that appeared two years later is a high-gloss thing, all breathy synths and pseudo-oriental melodies\xe2\x80\x94but this take, with its wispy Velvets jangle and gently deflating chorus, arguably captures the song\xe2\x80\x99s lyric of sorrowful abandonment all the more keenly.' b'Completing the package is liner notes written by Stephen Pastel, a friend of Strawberry Switchblade who, around the time these songs were recorded, was busy prepping the debut single by his own young group, the Pastels. Their music was, like that found on 4-Piece Demo, a little primitive and rough around the edges, but full of creativity and life. The Pastels would kickstart a whole new indie-pop fanzine culture, though, and prove extraordinarily resilient, remaining an ongoing concern today. Strawberry Switchblade were a band with many possible futures, and this demo offers just a fleeting glimpse of the group they could have become.'"
b'Rose Elinor Dougall',7.2,b'Stellular',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'February 2 2017',"b'Since leaving the Pipettes,\xc2\xa0Rose Elinor Dougal has quietly released an impressive trove of lovelorn pop music. Stellular is wry, frosty and swooning by turns, romantic but hesitant.'","b'The Pipettes as a group were never bound to last\xe2\x80\x94a decade on, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound so appealing to combine the girl-group fandom of indie rock with the schtick of Meghan Trainor and the singer-retention of the Sugababes. The Pipettes as a group of artists, though, have been remarkably prolific. Two years ago, Gwenno Saunders released the year\xe2\x80\x99s highest-concept album, the Welsh-language, sci-fi-enamored Y Dydd Olaf. Bandmate Rose Elinor Dougall, meanwhile has quietly released several albums and EPs\xe2\x80\x99 worth of lovelorn pop music. The comparison is inevitable\xe2\x80\x94both artists work in more or less the same vein of synthpop\xe2\x80\x94but where Gwenno prefers futurism, Dougall prefers romanticism. On tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cFallen Over\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHanging Around,\xe2\x80\x9d she sheds the self-consciousness and polka-dotted prurience of her old group for a disarmingly earnest swoon.' b'Stellular, produced with Oli Bayston of Boxed In\xc2\xa0(who also sings on and co-wrote \xe2\x80\x9cDive\xe2\x80\x9d) is not a departure from her past solo work\xe2\x80\x94if you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard any of the EPs, you know what to expect, and even if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, you can venture a guess. Dougall is a Pipettes alum; pastiche is expected. Specifically, most of Stellular wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist without the past several decades of post-punk (in particular, Blondie), and the rest of it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist without Trish Keenan and Sarah Cracknell. The lilting \xe2\x80\x9cTake Yourself With You\xe2\x80\x9d recalls \xe2\x80\x9970s folk, spacey Stereolab, and some of ABBA\xe2\x80\x99s pastoral, statelier tracks. As influences, they\xe2\x80\x99re ideal\xe2\x80\x94they don\xe2\x80\x99t lend themselves to kitsch so much as sturdy, comfortable arrangements that Dougall\xc2\xa0inhabits with love and familiarity.' b""Take the title track: it begins bramble-spiky, but Dougall makes it entrancing. She winds through verbosities like \xe2\x80\x9cHopes and despairs in parallel live wildly side by side\xe2\x80\x9d effortlessly, almost distracted. It\xe2\x80\x99s a love song, but a hesitant one, caught between prickly guitars and moony sentiments, warning itself off in the bridge: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re giving yourself away again.\xe2\x80\x9d The title, as precisely chosen as the rest, compares her would-be partner to a small star; full-on cosmic crushing is just not something the narrator allows herself. She does allow herself the more earthy kind on \xe2\x80\x9cCloser\xe2\x80\x9d: closing time in some arbitrary bar, gazing at\xc2\xa0someone who\xe2\x80\x99d rather blather on about something so much less important than moving their hand that last crucial centimeter. Dougall\xe2\x80\x99s a wry songwriter when she wants to be, and she delivers these details to match, but the way her coy chorus and frosty \xe2\x80\x9cI don't care about your band\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s 3:45 a.m.\xe2\x80\x9d melt within seconds reveals her hopes, and the speeding-heartbeat guitar lick, her blissful impatience. The other blatant new wave cut, \xe2\x80\x9cAll at Once,\xe2\x80\x9d pulls the same sleight-of-heart. There\xe2\x80\x99s as much \xe2\x80\x9cRapture\xe2\x80\x9d in it as actual rapture; the funk and whispers and \xe2\x80\x9ctonight\xe2\x80\x9ds affect cool and do it quite well, but the lyrics\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cGive me apathy...sentence me to heaven\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94merely aspires toward it, from a longing place."" b""Indeed, what elevates Stellular from just another decade\xe2\x80\x99s nostalgia exercise is that longing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer Me,\xe2\x80\x9d while the weakest track here\xe2\x80\x94Dougall\xe2\x80\x99s posh voice doesn't navigate soft-rock or R&B ballads well\xe2\x80\x94redeems itself in its final minute, a plush pile of backing vocals; \xe2\x80\x9cSpace to Be\xe2\x80\x9d is nothing but redemption. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sequel to \xe2\x80\x9cStellular\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the chorus melody is tucked into the synths\xe2\x80\x94set in the same city with the same loneliness, but none of the hesitation. The chorus might lend itself to a girl-group arrangement, and certainly the sentiment would: \xe2\x80\x9cI want a love to lift me up high, to wreak havoc on this heart of mine, tear me limb from limb until I find some kind of space to be.\xe2\x80\x9d But where the Pipettes would give it irony or sex somewhere, and just about every other girl-group revivalist would lean into the darkness and violence, Dougall leaves it at full-throated emotion."""
b'BANANA',6.6,b'LIVE',0,b'Experimental',b'February 2 2017',"b'The six-piece BANANA features\xc2\xa0members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers\xc2\xa0and Warpaint, as well as\xc2\xa0the singer Cate Le Bon.\xc2\xa0LIVE is a playful, energetic session, influenced by Arthur Russell and Jon Hassell.'","b'In March of last year, six musicians congregated in a house in Los Angeles, intent on making something original. Their band, BANANA, originally assembled as an opening act and backing group for the singer Cate Le Bon, included members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Warpaint as well as Le Bon herself, coming off of her excellent 2016 release Crab Day. The ensemble was helmed by Josiah Steinbrick, a producer and fixture of the L.A. music scene who\xe2\x80\x99s collaborated with Devendra Banhart, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Tim Presley of White Fence.' b'The musicians had gotten familiar with each other while touring\xc2\xa0Crab Day, and it seems that they were in an even looser mood than usual when they came together to record what would become LIVE, a mix that uses original compositions by Steinbrick as a jumping-off point for the rest of the musicians to improvise over. Influenced by the recordings of the trumpeter and composer Jon Hassell and incorporating the work of Arthur Russell, the playful, energetic LIVE*\xc2\xa0*was originally recorded as a special for the online radio station Dublab. But it proved to have staying power, so Leaving Records has issued it as a standalone album this month.' b'*LIVE\xc2\xa0*is comprised of four tracks named for the first four letters of the alphabet, and runs 24 minutes its length. Its tracks are predicated not on guitar, piano or drums, but on loops of vibraphone and woodwind, with other instruments chiming in wildly, a rainforest cacophony layered over the slower, deeper patterns of a lush musical ecosystem. Tracks don\xe2\x80\x99t develop in a linear fashion but instead grow outward in strange, unexpected directions. On \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cB,\xe2\x80\x9d this growth is segmented, as a second loop tags in to replace the first at the midpoint of each song. \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d are more coherent and as a result, more easily digestible.' b'Depending on the listener\xe2\x80\x99s mood, the record\xe2\x80\x99s early going can be frustratingly chipper. All those plinking mallets and that farting brass come to feel grating, a forced smile that stays on too long. But occasional moments of shade dull the insistent sunshine, providing some relief as you delve further into the record. Plaintive strings on the back side of \xe2\x80\x9cB\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0and the sudden jangle of piano two and half minutes through \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d cool things down, \xc2\xa0and \xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x9d by far the shortest track here, is decidedly the darkest, introducing a somber note that anchors an otherwise escapist record in the real world.' b'The compositions here forsake Western divisions of major and minor keys. This gives all the tracks a modal, somewhat hard-to-place flavor, particularly the baroque \xe2\x80\x9cB,\xe2\x80\x9d which makes use of ceremonial music from Southeast Asia and incorporates a minimalist piece from the Estonian composer Heino J\xc3\xbcrisalu, before morphing into a tribute to Arthur Russell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9970s work that includes a yearning sample of electric piano from Russell himself.' b'Steinbrick has said that he wants the music to sound \xe2\x80\x9cexotic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpleasant,\xe2\x80\x9d both characteristics that LIVE\xc2\xa0nails easily. But after a half dozen listens, despite some of its more outr\xc3\xa9 qualities,\xc2\xa0LIVE\xc2\xa0starts to sound familiar, even tightly controlled. The members of BANANA\xc2\xa0know each other well, and on the record, they seem capable of anticipating their tourmates improvisational tendencies, like a conversation at the family dinner table where it\xe2\x80\x99s always obvious who\xe2\x80\x99s going to speak up next. That makes for a strikingly coherent improvised album. But it also dulls some of the surprises that LIVE*\xc2\xa0*might have otherwise offered, making something that was supposed to feel fresh and alive, seem occasionally, if not unhappily, predictable.'"

Since debuting with Tape One five years ago, the four-piece have never stopped shredding through corrupt power hierarchies and attempting to disentangle personal freedom from consumer choice. Across two tapes, a single, and an EP, they\xe2\x80\x99ve used a deranged sort of surf rock to launch lucid, grimly funny expos\xc3\xa9s of the false binaries and systemic oppressions that built America. This, after all, is the band that screamed, \xe2\x80\x9cBarack Obama killed something in me and I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get him for it.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'As we enter 2017, we\xe2\x80\x99re in danger of tying every faintly despairing new piece of culture to the ascent of America\xe2\x80\x99s Cheeto-in-Chief, as if January 20 flipped a switch that instantly soured all milk. But injustice wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born earlier this month; it just became apparent to many\xc2\xa0who never had much cause to worry about it before. And the lyrics to Nothing Feels Natural show the existential weight of having spent a lifetime fighting. Priests\xe2\x80\x99 debut has an entirely different energy from their previous releases, expanding into a rich diorama of stinging guitar, funk, yearning indie pop, and jazz. The leap in range and ambition from their 2015 EP Bodies and Control and Money and Power\xc2\xa0is huge: There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a punk debut this certain and poised since Savages\xe2\x80\x99 Silence Yourself.' b'The title works a few different ways. There\xe2\x80\x99s the obvious what the fuck sensation that accompanies your early morning Twitter scroll these days, and Priests have always done a mean line in sardonic disbelief. There\xe2\x80\x99s less of that on Nothing Feels Natural, though it\xe2\x80\x99s no less potent: \xe2\x80\x9cPink White House\xe2\x80\x9d is a hostile cheerleader chant about the illusion of choice, where the disorientation mounts alongside Taylor Mulitz\xe2\x80\x99s spiraling bass. On the boisterously funky \xe2\x80\x9cPuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Katie Alice Greer sneers at accelerationism\xe2\x80\x94the crackpot academic theory that society hitting rock bottom is good because it will surely engender radical change. And on \xe2\x80\x9cJJ,\xe2\x80\x9d she balks at how easily we let branding influence the way we construct identity. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was a cowboy because I smoked Reds,\xe2\x80\x9d Greer wails, as surf riffs and battered piano behind her evoke a debauched saloon caper.' b'Priests have always had a keen eye for fakery and bullshit, though on Nothing Feels Natural, they\xe2\x80\x99re confronting \xe2\x80\x98normalcy\xe2\x80\x99, a force far more insidious than artifice, because the partisan values informing it are invisible. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long movie, a long movie/And you are not you, you are not you,\xe2\x80\x9d Greer exhorts on opener \xe2\x80\x9cAppropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d Adding saxophone, piano and hand percussion to their sound, they change direction from song to song much in the same way that the Clash did with Sandinista!, and commit to every hairpin turn. \xe2\x80\x9cAppropriate\xe2\x80\x9d hurtles from spiny sloganeering through nihilistic thrash to a condemned doom jazz wasteland, leaving the listener as alienated as Priests feel. The title track brings to mind rain-thrashed British indie pop, and on \xe2\x80\x9cSuck,\xe2\x80\x9d Priests try their hand at nimble ESG-indebted funk, though Greer\xe2\x80\x99s frustrated pleas expose the dark underbelly of the New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 effervescent cool. She had to stop screaming because it was killing her throat. The desperation in her singing voice might be more jarring than her howls.' b'Priests have always been thrillingly direct, but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped their words being twisted by publicists who want to profit from them (\xe2\x80\x9cYou hinge your success on that which you might bleed from me,\xe2\x80\x9d Greer sneers on \xe2\x80\x9cNicki\xe2\x80\x9d) and guilty parties who interpret their calls for respect as personal attacks (\xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t make me be someone with no sympathy,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleads on \xe2\x80\x9cSuck\xe2\x80\x9d). Here, they sound unusually worn down by commodification, a lack of good faith from those around them, and the difficulty of surviving as a punk band: the title Nothing Feels Natural could also signify that the abyss has started to feel like home. We\xe2\x80\x99re told that this is where punk thrives, at the bottom of the barrel\xe2\x80\x94accelerationism, again. Priests reject that idea in the most forceful terms. Led by drummer Daniele Daniele in a relentless, disbelieving sing-speak, the terrifying \xe2\x80\x9cNo Big Bang\xe2\x80\x9d peers into the void of shame and failure that accompanies creativity. On the title track, a depressed Greer satirizes the sacrifices she\xe2\x80\x99d make to feel balanced again. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I go without for days will I finally hallucinate a real thing?\xe2\x80\x9d she pleads. The self\xc2\xa0becomes a slippery concept: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are born and dying inside of me all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Greer sings on \xe2\x80\x9cLelia 20.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'When kakistocracy reigns and George Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s 1984 is a bestseller again, you might wonder if now\xe2\x80\x99s the best time for Priests to get introspective. But their insistence on wriggling free from definition and feeling the weight of darkness has roots in resistance. On \xe2\x80\x9cNicki,\xe2\x80\x9d which rings with cavernous dread, Greer intones, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t make friends easily or naturally,\xe2\x80\x9d sliding over the consonants like an eel escaping grasping hands. Priests\xe2\x80\x99 insistence on mutable identity, and their disinterest in pinning down a 10-point plan to vanquish fascism, let them slip free of those who seek to gentrify, identify, commodify.\xc2\xa0In a society where it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming increasingly apparent to everyone that your words can and will be used against you, Nothing Feels Natural is a valuable philosophy.'"
b'Urochromes',7.8,b'Night Bully EP',0,b'Rock',b'February 1 2017',"b'In an underground scene\xc2\xa0where guitar bands tend to be one trick ponies, pummeling punk duo Urochromes\xe2\x80\x99 unpredictability lends them\xc2\xa0a rare star quality.'","b'Urochrome, singular, is the pigment that determines the color of urine. Urochromes, plural, are\xc2\xa0the pummeling duo from Western Massachusetts that\xc2\xa0released a handful of noisy hardcore platters over the past two years on underground punk labels. Frontman Jackie Jackieboy commands attention with his rabid, yammering screams. Dick Riddick is the shredder, responsible for solos and the band\xe2\x80\x99s massive, gnarly guitar tone. Their drummer is (literally) a machine. On their first release, 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Get in Line 4 Mental Decline, Jackie shout-sang about pissing in a bottle in his room, and then, pissing on his best friend. At a glance, that appears to be the ceiling for Urochromes\xe2\x80\x94fun, volatile, rapid-fire scatological\xc2\xa0punk. With their new EP Night Bully, the duo and their robot drummer seek paths beyond hardcore\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic limitations.' b""The title track begins with crackling guitars mingling with deep, burbling electronics. Jackie forgoes a\xc2\xa0scream, focusing all his intensity into an aggressive, rhythmic whisper. The title \xe2\x80\x9cNight Bully\xe2\x80\x9d suggests \xc2\xa0intimidation, and there is definitely a posturing pushiness to its narrative. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the new muscle/Everyone needs a secret hustle,\xe2\x80\x9d Jackie notes, menacingly, before prodding further: \xe2\x80\x9cYou should know that/You should *really *know that.\xe2\x80\x9d He repeatedly demands that you \xe2\x80\x9cbe the uromancer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94someone who divines the future by reading urine bubbles. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only overt reference to piss, and it\xe2\x80\x99s puerile, yes, but it's also\xc2\xa0an incomprehensible, psychedelic call to action."" b'\xe2\x80\x9cNight Bully\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s overall tone isn\xe2\x80\x99t unprecedented for Urochromes. The band had already been working with drum machines, and their obsession with industrial punk acts like Chrome came through loud and clear on their 2015 cover of \xe2\x80\x9cChromosome Damage.\xe2\x80\x9d Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s whispers take that aesthetic into new territory. The EP\xe2\x80\x99s closing track, however, comes out of left field. The Northampton, Massachusetts-based coldwave duo Boy Harsher deliver a remix of \xe2\x80\x9cNight Bully\xe2\x80\x9d that renders the source material unrecognizable. A smooth, beatific synthesizer melody floats over a pulsing drone as a somber Jae Matthews croons the same words Jackie had just been aggressively whispering. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wholly unexpected turn, but the synth pop jam shares Urochromes\xe2\x80\x99 sonic DNA. There are familiar stabs of darkness that come through\xe2\x80\x94demonic voices and the occasional squeal of guitar. It\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome note to end on.' b'The record\xe2\x80\x99s entire A-side, by contrast, shows Urochromes at the height of their hardcore powers. Riddick\xe2\x80\x99s hooks are polished on \xe2\x80\x9cConfront Ya,\xe2\x80\x9d and the drum machine ratchets up the\xc2\xa0urgency. Jackie ladles bile on his target\xe2\x80\x94someone who boasts\xc2\xa0about finding success while outlining their plans to climb the ladder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to crush me with your boot,\xe2\x80\x9d he observes before bellowing with disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to move to L.A.!\xe2\x80\x9d Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s frustration holds sway on \xe2\x80\x9cMy Disposition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94his disposition, apparently, is that he always manages to blow a relationship before it even gets off the ground.\xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of Night Bully\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re frustrated, and they\xe2\x80\x99re lashing out.' b'Urochromes\xe2\x80\x99 new one is about 11 minutes long (if you don\xe2\x80\x99t count the second Boy Harsher remix that\xe2\x80\x99s offered as a digital bonus), and within those time constraints, they build an emotionally complex and sonically elaborate world. This chaotic, always-fluctuating, heavy music undercuts self-consciousness, bitterness, anger, and an unsettling self-confidence. It\xe2\x80\x99s a record that\xc2\xa0easily lends itself to shoving or dancing (or, you know, both) before arriving at a\xc2\xa0shimmering, uncharacteristic come-down. Given how ambitious these 11 minutes are, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to predict where they go from here. In an underground scene\xc2\xa0where guitar bands tend be one trick ponies, Urochromes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0unpredictability lends them\xc2\xa0a rare star quality.'"
b'Cuddle Magic',7.3,b'Ashes/Axis',0,b'Rock',b'February 1 2017',"b""On their fourth album proper, Cuddle Magic dive into the pop side of chamber pop with more fluency and confidence\xc2\xa0than they've ever shown in the past.""","b""Individual members of the chamber pop group Cuddle Magic have worked with the likes of Beyonc\xc3\xa9, Amanda Palmer, and Okkervil River.\xc2\xa0But for better or worse Cuddle Magic have never come across as pop-music natives. Their conservatory training always shows through in the combination of complex structures, bright harmonies, and snappy humor that has defined their sound.\xc2\xa0Ashes/Axis marks a major turning point. The proper follow-up to 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Info Nympho\xc2\xa0(following a 2014 full-length collaboration with toy pianist Phyllis Chen and pianist Ran Blake), Ashes/Axis captures Cuddle Magic diving into the \xe2\x80\x9cpop\xe2\x80\x9d side of \xe2\x80\x9cchamber pop\xe2\x80\x9d with more fluency and confidence\xc2\xa0than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever shown in the past. Right off the bat, the smooth, spit-shined mix by Bryce Goggin (Pavement, Atony and the Johnsons) contrasts dramatically with the dusty immediacy of the band's previous records. From the\xc2\xa0fat, synthetic groove of leadoff track \xe2\x80\x9cSlow Rider\xe2\x80\x9d onward, they've traded the primarily acoustic instrumentation of past work for gurgling, bottom-heavy synths and electronic drumbeats."" b""On Let It Be You, last year\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration between Cuddle Magic bandleader Benjamin Lazar Davis and Joan As Policewoman, Lazar Davis went for the commercial jugular with an audacious turn at arena-ready bubblegum R&B. In some ways, Ashes/Axis behaves as a companion piece to that album. Like Let It Be You, several of the songs have a basis in intertwined Ghanaian rhythmic patterns. And it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that Let It Be You's bassy thump was still in Lazar Davis\xe2\x80\x99 ear when he sat with Goggin to run the original studio tracks for Ashes/Axis through post-production effects."" b""But Lazar Davis\xe2\x80\x99 bandmates bring such strong presence to the table that they offset the exaggerated, sweaty-handkerchief affectations that nearly turned Let It Be You into a caricature. Though Lazar Davis remains the principal songwriter, Cuddle Magic\xe2\x80\x99s fellow multi-instrumentalists Christopher McDonald and Alec Spiegelman also contributed songs, as did guest co-writers like Bridget Kearney of Lake Street Dive and Lip Talk\xe2\x80\x99s Sarah K. Pedinotti. With all those hands on deck, it's no surprise that Ashes/Axis contains more layers, both musically and thematically. And Kristin Slipp\xe2\x80\x99s vocals, whether she sings lead or backup, serve as a kind of backbone that binds\xc2\xa0the album together."" b'Where Joan Wasser opted to keep pace with Lazar Davis\xe2\x80\x99 playful melodramatics on Let It Be You, Slipp\xe2\x80\x99s more reserved style conveys an infinitely wider range of emotions. If you go back to the Info Nympho track \xe2\x80\x9cHoarders,\xe2\x80\x9d she invests the line \xe2\x80\x9cShit/that/fills/our/homes/is/too/hea-/-vy/to/move/and/so/we/leave/it\xe2\x80\x9d (a veiled reference to feeling trapped in a relationship) with a lingering resentment that belies the tune\xe2\x80\x99s quirkiness. On Ashes/Axis, Slipp approaches her vocal parts like an actress with a healthy aversion to overstatement. Once again, she laces the music with faint traces of woe, bringing a sense of everyday believability to the songs even when the lyrics aren\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly clear.' b'When Slipp harmonizes with McDonald on the line ""give me the keys / to your condo"" on the new tune ""Getaway,"" her voice supplies an extra touch of mournfulness to an already melancholy mood. Easily the most haunting and atmosphere-heavy Cuddle Magic song to date, the song percolates with detail. Throughout the whole album, Lazar Davis and Goggin find creative ways to vary the balance between natural sounds and effects. On ""Getaway,"" they filter a helium-pitched Slipp vocal (that\'s not actually pitched-up) to mimic violin strumming. And when they turn McDonald and Slipp\'s vocals into spectral blurs of reverb at the beginning and end of the tune, the music causes goosebumps, scaling breathtaking heights the band has never attempted before.' b'Strangely enough, Cuddle Magic\xe2\x80\x99s move to a chillier, more digitized palette actually adds dimension to the songs. By reaching outside their comfort zone, they bring the content of the songs to the foreground. Which is not to say the band has lost its organic flavor. On the contrary: at the end of the quasi-title track, \xe2\x80\x9cThe First Hippie on the Moon, Pt. I,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, the music unravels as all of the instruments simply collapse into chaos. At that moment, Cuddle Magic land surprisingly close to a rock band, closing its set out in a heap of smoldering noise. By that point, though, the band\xe2\x80\x99s transformation into a formidable pop act is already complete.'"
b'Age Coin',6.3,b'Performance',0,b'Electronic',b'February 1 2017',"b'The Copenhagen duo Age Coin features two former members of the post-punk band Lower producing bleak industrial techno. Their second LP\xc2\xa0is inconsistent, but shows promise.'","b'Though Age Coin produces industrial techno, the Copenhagen duo isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite of the club. Kristian Emdal and Simon Formann were both members of the now-defunct post-punk band Lower, and their proximity to punk and noise is tangible on\xc2\xa0Performance, their second full-length, which echoes the intense, bleak temperaments of the bands who have come to define that scene. While the release\xe2\x80\x99s best moments are intricate and beat-driven, its dominant mode seems located more in its interludes of thinly-built, staticky unease. Taken as a whole, these stops and starts can feel less intentionally unsteady and more flat-out inconsistent.' b'In terms of cultivating a mood,\xc2\xa0*Performance\xc2\xa0*starts on a high note. Opener \xe2\x80\x9cEsprit\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s rumbling bass crawls into focus, low-end slowly receding to highlight a single tinny beat. It\xe2\x80\x99s dread-inducing, but also engaging and concise. The lead single \xe2\x80\x9cRaptor,\xe2\x80\x9d far and away the release\xe2\x80\x99s standout track, follows in this vein: its staccato rhythm is tempered with broad, wavering strokes of melody, creating a rare sense of breathing room. It\xe2\x80\x99s reminiscent of textured, Modern Love-style ambient techno, like a softer-edged Demdike Stare.' b'Elsewhere, things turn more abstract, and more claustrophobic. \xe2\x80\x9cDamp\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s horror-film textures ruminate for a few minutes before opening into cold, insistent percussion, never quite boiling over into true noise. \xe2\x80\x9cProtein\xe2\x80\x9d is similarly soaked in chilling atmospherics, structured around an anxious, fragmentary jungle beat. In a jarring change of pace, \xe2\x80\x9cDomestic I\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDomestic II\xe2\x80\x9d dispense with beats altogether, instead overlaying a persistent buzz and clatter with mournful instrumentation: on \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d a cello met with whining harmonies, and on \xe2\x80\x9cII,\xe2\x80\x9d a pretty, rickety piano solo.\xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not unattractive compositions, but for the time they take up on this otherwise fairly brief release, these interludes don\xe2\x80\x99t feel particularly well-integrated or useful.' b'Moments of\xc2\xa0Performance\xc2\xa0offer\xc2\xa0welcome glimpses of something more complex than their once-stated mission to evoke\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfeeling really low in a corner of the club.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cRaptor\xe2\x80\x9d gives a particularly danceable example of this forward movement, but more fearsome moments like closer \xe2\x80\x9cHeadron\xe2\x80\x9d are also promising. At their best, Age Coin synthesize the ambient and industrial mood-building of their past and concurrent projects with the physicality of techno, inducing anxiety through the occasional application of a frenetic texture. A more exciting approach might\xc2\xa0dispense with the instrumental experiments and embrace this path full-on.'"
b'Migos',8.1,b'Culture',1,b'Rap',b'January 31 2017',b'The Atlanta trio Migos come back after a commercial and creative dry spell with a #1 single and a definitive work.',"b'Okay, just for a second\xe2\x80\x94as a thought experiment\xe2\x80\x94let\xe2\x80\x99s treat Culture as the sophomore album from the Migos. In this reality, it marks a sharp improvement from the North Atlanta trio\xe2\x80\x99s debut, 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Yung Rich Nation, an album that showed a tremendous amount of technical dexterity, but stiffer writing and only half-formed pop instincts. The Migos are better now, we\xe2\x80\x99d say. They really grew.' b'In the real world, of course, Culture comes in a long, long line of hits, mixtapes, and one-offs. Since \xe2\x80\x9cVersace\xe2\x80\x9d and Y.R.N. (Young Rich Niggas) marked their breakthrough in 2013, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been one of the most influential acts in hip-hop, and frequently one of the best. Their most obvious mark on the culture has been the tight, triplet-laced flow they resurrected and perfected. They also brought the dab to the world at large, and injected a handful of slang terms into the syntaxes of aspiring rappers from coast to coast.' b'So Culture arrives in what feels like the second act of a long career, by rap standards. The Migos came out as young upstarts, suffered through a litany of legal hang-ups and incarcerations, had short creative dry spells where they sniped at the kids on the lawn stealing their styles, and eventually came back around. This time, they have a #1 hit in tow, and they want to stick at the top of the commercial pyramid.' b'The first voice you hear on Culture is DJ Khaled\xe2\x80\x99s, which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more misleading. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a big-budget parade of set pieces and stunt casting; if anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable for how long stretches of it are sober, somber. Culture\xe2\x80\x99s midpoint is the phenomenal, Zaytoven-produced \xe2\x80\x9cBig on Big,\xe2\x80\x9d which is towering and defiant, and even flips their well-documented label troubles into a point of pride. That track is followed by two more (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the Price,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBrown Paper Bag\xe2\x80\x9d) that stick to minor keys and contemplative piano. There are plenty of stray prescription pills and idle threats to go around, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve been reassembled to be eerier, more perilous. (Incidentally, this would have been a perfect place to insert \xe2\x80\x9cCocoon,\xe2\x80\x9d their staggering loosie from last year.)' b'Culture\xc2\xa0is front-loaded with singles, which\xe2\x80\x94perhaps counter-intuitively\xe2\x80\x94makes for a nice balance. Heard back-to-back-to-back, \xe2\x80\x9cT-Shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCall Casting,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBad and Boujee\xe2\x80\x9d are not only packed with color and virtuosic rapping, but elucidate exactly what each of the three rappers bring to the table, how they complement one another. Hearing Quavo float is a joy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s even better when it\xe2\x80\x99s underscored by Takeoff\xe2\x80\x99s bass and Offset\xe2\x80\x99s serration. There are also fascinating reconciliations:\xc2\xa0The Cardo-produced,\xc2\xa02 Chainz-featuring \xe2\x80\x9cDeadz\xe2\x80\x9d seems to find a middle ground between the sparse Atlanta sounds and Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s maximalism that were warring around the time of\xc2\xa0Y.R.N.' b'Then there\xc2\xa0are truly strange moments. \xe2\x80\x9cAll Ass,\xe2\x80\x9d from the album\xe2\x80\x99s (uh) back end, sounds like Magic City mixed with industrial Berlin. \xe2\x80\x9cSlippery,\xe2\x80\x9d in an inspired move, turns a \xe2\x80\x9cskrrt skrrt\xe2\x80\x9d ad-lib into the song\xe2\x80\x99s melodic backbone. Even when Culture grasps for the radio dial, it skirts expectations.\xc2\xa0The arc here is not one of artists leaving their roots to chase pop\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s pop coming back around to accommodate them.' b'While the Migos are decidedly of Atlanta (coupled with some cadences from up in Tennessee), their records frequently remind you of rap\xe2\x80\x99s earlier years, when creative kids holed up in bedrooms and tried to impress or make each other laugh\xe2\x80\x94think The Migos Is Dead or Bizarre Ride II Nawfside. Culture might have national aspirations, but it\xe2\x80\x99s charged with the energy of history, of family. On \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the Price,\xe2\x80\x9d Takeoff raps about the teachers and preachers of his youth who presented an inaccessible, exclusionary path forward. When he shirks that (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ma go find me a better route\xe2\x80\x9d), it\xe2\x80\x99s not flippant, it\xe2\x80\x99s resolute.' b'Later on the same song, Offset runs through a consumer fever dream, anchored by the line \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on going out sad today.\xe2\x80\x9d In other contexts, that might be a curious aside, but over Ricky Racks, 808Godz and KeanuBeats\xe2\x80\x99 somber track, it sounds like the album\xe2\x80\x99s spiritual center. The Migos are (probably) not better than the Beatles,\xc2\xa0but their existence shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reduced to memes that debate the issue. On Culture, their world is richly rendered, full of hopes and paranoia and unbridled joy. This gives the Migos the last laugh on those who thought they\xe2\x80\x99d never crack the retail album format, marked all the while by the knowledge they never needed one to succeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s a definitive work.'"

But truth be told, the hybrid of hip-hop and UK garage never went anywhere\xe2\x80\x94the only thing that changed was the genre\xe2\x80\x99s visibility. Ever since grime\xe2\x80\x99s emergence on British pirate radio at the turn of the millennium, the UK mainstream (not to mention American listeners) has tended to pay attention to the genre only when it produces a charismatic star. Wiley knows this better than most. He was a chief architect of grime\xe2\x80\x99s early sound (his tracks were among the first\xc2\xa0to be labeled \xe2\x80\x9cgrime\xe2\x80\x9d), assembled the seminal Roll Deep crew, helped his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 Dizzee Rascal become grime\xe2\x80\x99s first breakout artist and later, pushed the genre even deeper into the mainstream with a string of successful club-pop singles. He\xe2\x80\x99s somehow managed to weather the interest of a fickle public for two full decades, though he has plenty of scars to show for it. In response to allegations of selling out, he\xe2\x80\x99s spent a good deal of his career apologizing for and actively disowning any attempts he\xe2\x80\x99s made to court a wider audience, though his frequent course-corrections have sometimes felt more like self-sabotage. He\xe2\x80\x99s a survivor, if not a particularly triumphant one.' b""Given this history, you\xe2\x80\x99d think Wiley would be frustrated to find that the latest wave of grime artists have arrived at\xc2\xa0success far more easily and on their own terms: for today\xe2\x80\x99s emcees, staying true to grime\xe2\x80\x99s sound and topping the charts are hardly mutually exclusive. Instead, Wiley seems reinvigorated by his peers' achievements, especially those\xc2\xa0of Skepta, the latest of his mentees to follow in Dizzee\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps, Mercury Prize and all. Supposedly his parting gift to the culture he helped birth, Godfather finds Wiley attempting to pull off the same trick that Skepta did with Konnichiwa: a lifer goes back to his roots and channels the energy of a hungry upstart. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tall order for a rapper pushing 40 but Godfather largely delivers, feeling at once like a return to form for Wiley and a celebration of grime\xe2\x80\x99s foundational sound."" b""Part of the album\xe2\x80\x99s success stems from its single-minded focus. Unlike many of Wiley's albums,\xc2\xa0Godfather tends to cut to the chase, that being manic, double-time rapping over chirpy 140 bpm beats. Production has always been Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s primary strength but on Godfather, he mostly absolves himself of those duties, turning over the boards to young upstarts like Preditah and Swifta Beater, as well as seasoned vets like Rude Kid. Still, each of these collaborators works in service of the overarching mission: songs that update Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s blocky \xe2\x80\x9ceskibeat\xe2\x80\x9d sound using modern production techniques."" b'Wiley has never been a great rapper per se, but on every song here he shows up with a surplus of energy, confidence and charisma. On the frantic \xe2\x80\x9cBait Face,\xe2\x80\x9d he goes bar-for-bar with his old crewmate Scratchy without breaking a sweat. He sounds right at home on the torch-passing posse cut \xe2\x80\x9cName Brand,\xe2\x80\x9d which brings together Roll Deep member J2K with Jme and Frisco from Boy Better Know. On tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cBirds N Bars\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t Go Wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he\xc2\xa0borrows Skepta\xe2\x80\x99s breathless flow but cuts it with a halting, staccato delivery. There are, of course, a few corny one-liners scattered throughout the record (\xe2\x80\x9cI stand out like one break light,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFresh out the oven like a Sunday roast,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re plain, I\xe2\x80\x99m the loaded nachos\xe2\x80\x9d) and even an entire song dedicated to his MacBook Pro (\xe2\x80\x9cLaptop\xe2\x80\x9d). However, at this point in Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s career, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for this stuff to read as anything but endearingly goofy, more like dad jokes than genuine missteps.' b'Ultimately, Godfather is a thoroughly enjoyable record, one that manages to leverage grime\xe2\x80\x99s elemental sounds in a way that feels vital and forward-looking. Sure, its peaks might not be quite as high as those of Konnichiwa, the record that it\xe2\x80\x99s bound to be measured against (Skepta\xe2\x80\x99s mastery of the massive, shout-along hook continues to give him an edge). But for anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s ever rooted for Wiley, it\xe2\x80\x99s a deeply satisfying listen. After all, until recently, Wiley disowned not just the \xe2\x80\x9cgodfather of grime\xe2\x80\x9d nickname but the term \xe2\x80\x9cgrime\xe2\x80\x9d altogether. And here he is, unapologetically owning his influence, toasting to his peers\xe2\x80\x99 successes and claiming his rightful place as grime\xe2\x80\x99s elder statesman. Who knows if Godfather is actually Wiley\xe2\x80\x99s final solo album\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly heard that one from him before. But if it is, he can step away knowing that his legacy has been secured.'"
b'Various Artists',7.8,b'Sensate Silk',0,,b'January 31 2017',"b""In the wake of the tragic Ghost Ship fire,\xc2\xa0100% Silk has released Sensate Silk, a well-curated compilation that doubles as a rallying cry for dance music's underground.""","b""Britt and Amanda Brown never could have imagined that their record label would one day make national news, or that it would happen under the worst possible circumstances. Founded in 2011, 100% Silk began as a home for scrappy electronic artists from various musical backgrounds. Their predominant sound, a lo-fi approach that became known as \xe2\x80\x9coutsider house\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chipster house,\xe2\x80\x9d was decidedly niche\xe2\x80\x94dance music by and for experimental, DIY music communities. But last year, on December 2, 100% Silk became widely mentioned outside of their usual circles. A fire broke out that Friday in an Oakland warehouse known as the Ghost Ship, where an event featuring some of the label's artists was underway, and it claimed 36 lives. Amanda wrote on Facebook the next day: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened in Oakland is an unbelievable tragedy, a nightmare scenario. Britt and I are beside ourselves, utterly devastated.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b""The Ghost Ship fire was more than tragic national news; it sent a resounding shockwave through underground music communities around the world. As the names, photos, and stories of the deceased began to surface, a common response from musicians and fans was that it all \xe2\x80\x9chit so close to home.\xe2\x80\x9d Many saw themselves in the faces and lives of the lost; there were those who were meant to attend the party that night but didn't, those who would have been there if they'd been in town, and of course there were those who lost their dear friends and family. Among the numerous young, talented people killed in the fire were 100% Silk artists Johnny Igaz, aka Nackt, and Chelsea Faith Dolan, aka Cherushii. Nearly two months later, relief events continue providing a place to honor and mourn these vibrant lives that feel all too familiar."" b""In his article about the Oakland DIY scene in the fire's aftermath, Sam Lefebvre underlined the necessity of places like the Ghost Ship with a quote invoking the words of MLK: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople need places to gather in Beloved Community.\xe2\x80\x9d More than just a concert or a dance party, the 100% Silk showcase was a gathering for locals and likeminded visitors, a space to explore and develop their culture. It was an event not unlike countless others that happen every night around the world, many of which have since come under scrutiny or been shut down by law enforcement. The Ghost Ship tragedy has brought about a renewed focus on safety in DIY venues, but it has also put them at greater risk. In the midst of this, 100% Silk has released Sensate Silk, a well-curated compilation that doubles as a rallying cry for dance music's underground."" b'Sensate Silk was conceived as the label\xe2\x80\x99s 100th release well before December 2, but it has come to represent more than a milestone in their catalog. For some it\xe2\x80\x99s a memorial, featuring one of the last tracks written by Nackt, the patient, cheerful acid of \xe2\x80\x9cRising Tide.\xe2\x80\x9d Or it\xe2\x80\x99s an embodiment of intertwined global scenes, with beautiful deep house from Japanese artists Keita Sano and Inoue Shirabe alongside a bass-loaded banger by LA\xe2\x80\x99s Sage Caswell and meditative melodies from UK producer Helios Mode. The compilation is also an important show of perseverance from a label and community still reeling from disaster. In a Facebook post at the end of 2016, Britt Brown wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cThis has been a negative year for plenty of other reasons. But music brought us together. And music will keep us together.\xe2\x80\x9d The sentiment seems to pulse through every synth and drum machine on Sensate Silk.' b'From the soulful atmosphere this kind of house music exudes, Sensate Silk fosters a sense of healing as well. \xe2\x80\x9cRoses\xe2\x80\x9d is a groovy, intricate standout by Donny, an alias of Golden Donna, who survived the Ghost Ship fire. Its energy is split between contemplative chords, distant vocal abstractions, and a lively bounce, like a dancer whose memories follow them into the club. PARC\xe2\x80\x99s 11-minute \xe2\x80\x9cSilk Road\xe2\x80\x9d rises from burbling electronics into a cosmic dancefloor embrace, while the sax Cromie weaves through the plush \xe2\x80\x9cShe Knew\xe2\x80\x9d resonates with quiet heartache. These songs weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily written as balm for listeners, but their thoughtfulness and delicate natures will graciously soothe those who need it.' b""At the end of Sensate Silk is a song by unknown Berlin artist Westcoast Goddess. \xe2\x80\x9cUntitled Soul \xe2\x80\x9898\xe2\x80\x9d is the compilation's brightest highlight, and not just because it has an uncommon way with tension and euphoria. Its buoyant slow build sounds lovingly handmade, with hi-hats clattering slightly too loud and a central synth loop that shifts and swells like a DJ mixing on the fly. Seven bubbly minutes in, it culminates in a brilliant lead line that could coax hands into the air as soon as bring a tear to the eye. Closing a compilation that\xe2\x80\x99s heavy with meaning for many people, \xe2\x80\x9cUntitled Soul \xe2\x80\x9998\xe2\x80\x9d is a welcome burst of joy after months of grief. It\xe2\x80\x99s only fitting that those who are still here should remember those who are gone in celebration of the music they lived to support and create."""
b'Los Lichis',8.0,b'Dog',0,b'Experimental',b'January 31 2017',"b'This Mexico City-based experimental collective\xc2\xa0has been operating underground for over 20 years.\xc2\xa0Here,\xc2\xa0Feeding Tube Records reissues a vital compilation of their\xc2\xa0art-rock psychedelia.'","b'With our crate-digger culture reaching peak levels, it\xe2\x80\x99s always surprising to find an artist that has been making music for over 20 years and\xc2\xa0hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already been anthologized. That\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the surprise arrival of Los Lichis, a collective of experimental musicians and visual artists from Mexico City that first started working together in 1996, such a vital shock to the system. Chances are the recent reissue by Massachusetts-based\xc2\xa0Feeding Tube Records of Dog, a comp culling from the group\xe2\x80\x99s self-released material, is the first time you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing of them.' b'The members of Los Lichis\xe2\x80\x94Jos\xc3\xa9 Luis Rojas, Gerardo Monsiv\xc3\xa1is, Manuel Mathar, and\xc2\xa0French sound artist Jean Baptiste Favory\xe2\x80\x94are entirely responsible for keeping below the cultural radar. Until recently, their music was only available for purchase in art galleries in Mexico. They have been slow to embrace digital distribution; their Bandcamp\xc2\xa0is just\xc2\xa0a couple months old. But from the sounds of this fantastic collection of dessicated art rock, cracked electronic experiments, and AM radio intrusions, their emergence from the shadows feels\xc2\xa0long overdue.' b'While the two-LP set isn\xe2\x80\x99t arranged chronologically, listening through reveals how these men evolved as musicians and improvisers. Their work from the late \xe2\x80\x9990s\xe2\x80\x94made before the arrival of Favory and his synthesizers\xe2\x80\x94is rough-hewn and exploratory, built from junky-sounding drum machine rhythms and warbling electronic melodies. It has the excitement of Morton Subotnick compositions. Other tracks from that era, like the loopy and drowsy \xe2\x80\x9cOpium Boogie\xe2\x80\x9d and Throbbing Gristle-esque \xe2\x80\x9cOsaka \xe2\x80\x9977,\xe2\x80\x9d are a little more direct but remain\xc2\xa0suffused with a healthy dose of tape hiss and a playful energy.' b'As a producer, Favory\xe2\x80\x99s input through the \xe2\x80\x9900s on\xc2\xa0helped bring Los Lichis even further into focus. Favory\xc2\xa0met Mathar and Monsiv\xc3\xa1is when the pair showed their art at Paris\xe2\x80\x99s International Contemporary Art Fair (FIAC) in 2000, and since then, he\xc2\xa0has been a satellite member of the group, visiting Mexico once a year for improv sessions and performances. His impact helped clean up their recordings considerably, and it\xc2\xa0also brought a welcome psych rock influence to the proceedings. \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99Origine de la Guitare Fant\xc3\xb4me\xe2\x80\x9d slinks from its slow, glittery build into a nicely dawdling Dead-like jam punctuated by insistent keyboard bleats. \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99In\xc3\xa9vitable Catastrophe,\xe2\x80\x9d meanwhile, has the overwhelming gush of a Loveless\xc2\xa0interlude.' b'What this collection is missing is the more overt political commentary that has been central to the visual work that Los Lichis has done on their own and as a collective. There are hints within certain song titles\xe2\x80\x94the early Sonic Youth sounding \xe2\x80\x9cKrondstat Variation\xe2\x80\x9d is an apparent reference to the site of a major uprising during the Russian Civil War, and an overmodulated blues jam from 2002 is given the name \xe2\x80\x9cEva und Adolf\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but otherwise, the music could have even more impact if married with some of the group\xe2\x80\x99s striking videos and paintings. Even without visual accompaniment, Los Lichis retain that naturalistic spark and simmering wildness that only the best improvised music can provide.'"

The album is best when it's most vexing, while frontman Adam Schatz explores basic human sensation with a Cheshire Cat wit.""","b'Certain political travesties of the last few months have promoted a hands-over-ears response from even the most optimistic citizens, with logic drowned out by alternative\xc2\xa0facts and social media bloviations. Suddenly it feels much more difficult just to be in the world, which is the animating idea behind the third\xc2\xa0album by the Brooklyn collective Landlady. The World Is a Loud Place is one of those works of art that was made in one era but released in another, darker one. It\xe2\x80\x99s an album that perhaps wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intended to be political, but in 2017 it\xe2\x80\x99s inescapably politicized. Frontman and chief songwriter Adam Schatz isn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to topple regimes or even speak truth to errant power; rather, he\xe2\x80\x99s just trying to evoke the sensation of being in a human body at this point in time.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cFeel your heart beat once, there it goes again,\xe2\x80\x9d Schatz sings on \xe2\x80\x9cElectric Abdomen,\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s opener, as though the continuity of consciousness was a surprise. The song itself spools out in zig zags, changing direction and tempo abruptly and without warning. From their previous record to this one, the band have mastered a kind of lenticular prog-pop, defined by busybody arrangements and winding structures that form a fitting musical approximation of that .gif album cover: always in motion, always jumping from one idea to the next. \xe2\x80\x9cRest in Place\xe2\x80\x9d snakes around into a big brass fanfare, although it fades out before you can discern the motive: Is it triumphant or cautionary? Do those horns constitute a happy ending or is the killer still alive, ready to pounce at us once more?' b'Schatz presides over these songs with a mischievous glint in his eye\xe2\x80\x94half wiseacre Virgil leading us through a new American hellscape, part grinning Cheshire Cat sitting in inscrutable judgment. His lyrics recall the fragmented domestic scenery of recent Wilco tunes: trapped in first person, always trying to make sense of another person. \xe2\x80\x9cTeach me how you\xe2\x80\x99re organized,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings on \xe2\x80\x9cCadaver,\xe2\x80\x9d and it sounds like the most existential pick-up line imaginable. \xe2\x80\x9cJust be happy with the guts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\xe2\x80\x9d is his warped version of a kitten-poster platitude. It\xe2\x80\x99s a harsh world, but certainly not unpleasant to visit, thanks to Schatz\xe2\x80\x99s gnomic\xc2\xa0charisma.' b'Has anyone ever enunciated the word \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia\xe2\x80\x9d with as much loopy precision as he does on \xe2\x80\x9cDriving in California\xe2\x80\x9d? Schatz savors every consonant and vowel, then tosses the word out the car window with a distracted \xe2\x80\x9c-yeah.\xe2\x80\x9d The\xc2\xa0song is almost purposefully annoying, like a parody of tour songs or Golden State paeans: \xe2\x80\x9cDriving in Californ-yeah makes me forget everywhere that\xe2\x80\x99s not Californ-yeah.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Schatz moves eastward, first to Colorado and then to Niagara, picking up in cleverness along the way. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only track on The World Is a Loud Place where Schatz\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics are superficially sensical, where the lyrical conceit is too unwieldy for him and the agile band to handle.' b'The album is best when it\xe2\x80\x99s most vexing, when its puzzle-piece arrangements demand you put everything together. Part of the fun is following the circuitous routes these compositions take and hearing the oddball flourishes Landlady insert into the arrangements. Landlady craft a cacophony, but Schatz won\xe2\x80\x99t put his hands over his ears: There\xe2\x80\x99s some beauty in the noise that\xe2\x80\x99s worth going deaf to hear.'"
b'Kehlani',7.0,b'SweetSexySavage',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'January 30 2017',"b'The new album from R&B singer Kehlani Parrish\xc2\xa0is refreshingly\xc2\xa0self-assured. She\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot to say on these songs, which are blunt, unflinching, and exuberant.'","b'There are a couple of ways to tell the story of Kehlani Parrish\xe2\x80\x99s ascension from a gifted hopeful to a higher R&B court. One is a story of unhindered success: in her teens, Kehlani was the vocalist of a covers band that earned fourth place on \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Got Talent\xe2\x80\x9d and placed her on the radar of Nick Cannon and most major labels. Atlantic groomed her publicly and behind the scenes for cred and stardom, from 2014 mixtape *Cloud 19 *to 2015\xe2\x80\x99s album-called-mixtape You Should Be Here to heavy promotion at radio. By 2016, she\xe2\x80\x99d scored nods from both pop and pomp culture: a trendily morose cut on the soundtrack to\xe2\x80\x94brace yourself for the following phrase\xe2\x80\x94the Oscar-nominated *Suicide Squad *and a left-field Grammy nomination for a Best Urban Contemporary Album that is still a free set on SoundCloud.' b'The other story is one of overcoming the system. That \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s Got Talent\xe2\x80\x9d stint only panned out after several difficult years\xe2\x80\x94contractual hell, homelessness, depression\xe2\x80\x94and what followed was\xc2\xa0hardly fairytale. It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty uncontroversial now to recognize turn-of-the-century R&B as overflowing with innovation and talent, but A&Rs remain\xc2\xa0terrible at knowing what to do with it. For every *The Writing\xe2\x80\x99s on the Wall or Aaliyah,\xc2\xa0*there are three slept-on debuts and overlooked follow-ups, and who knows how many shelved, stalled, and otherwise mismanaged counterparts. The 2010s revival is more ephemeral in its streaming numbers and blog buzz, but not much kinder to its potential stars. Despite two hits in \xe2\x80\x9c2 On\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAll Hands on Deck,\xe2\x80\x9d Tinashe\xe2\x80\x99s *Joyride *tour was cut short. Kelela and SZA are excellent yet still \xe2\x80\x9crising.\xe2\x80\x9d Jhen\xc3\xa9 Aiko is in a group with Big Sean. And Kehlani\xe2\x80\x99s output and talent has consistently exceeded what its promotion would imply. *You Should Be Here *was a big-leagues album promoted like a mixtape\xe2\x80\x94an increasingly common blurred \xe2\x80\x9cindie\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmainstream\xe2\x80\x9d marketing tack\xe2\x80\x94and judging by the album features (Zayn?) and tour spots (G-Eazy) she\xe2\x80\x99s done since, the industry seems to be pigeonholing her with performers who are hilariously out of her league.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s even more remarkable, then, that *SweetSexySavage *is so self-assured: the work of a distinctive artist owning\xc2\xa0a style that seemingly everyone is attempting. Kehlani doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even try to disinvite comparisons\xe2\x80\x94the album\xe2\x80\x99s title is a direct play\xc2\xa0on TLC\xe2\x80\x99s CrazySexyCool, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0full of nods to the past, like the \xe2\x80\x9cTry Again\xe2\x80\x9d intro of \xe2\x80\x9cAdvice.\xe2\x80\x9d But unlike so much R&B, *SweetSexySavage *neither relies on nostalgia nor falls into the traps these throwback albums tend towards: treating R&B as a costume, the musical equivalent of a belly shirt, or recreating in hazy moods and amorphous vibes a genre better known for massive hooks.' b'The production helps. In addition to longtime producer Jahaan Sweet, *SweetSexySavage *brings in Pop & Oak\xe2\x80\x94among the more promising of pop-R&B production teams (Usher\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGood Kisser\xe2\x80\x9d is a highlight)\xe2\x80\x94and it avoids many diluted\xc2\xa0Top 40 names. \xe2\x80\x9cEscape\xe2\x80\x9d is a sweet mid-tempo ballad that flirts and flutters around the edge of saying \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t make you love me,\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99s also kind of like a Jordin Sparks album cut. The soundtrack cut \xe2\x80\x9cGangsta\xe2\x80\x9d is a clever update of 2000s thug-love tracks, like \xe2\x80\x9cSoldier\xe2\x80\x9d or almost any Ja Rule duet, to the glum mien of movie and radio pop, but it\xe2\x80\x99s rightly relegated to the bonus tracks.' b'Good production is relatively easy to find, though; voices like Kehlani\xe2\x80\x99s are not. Her closest Y2K peer is probably Kandi Burruss: a consummate songwriter equally adept at hitmaking and candor. Kehlani is a talented vocalist, but on record she\xe2\x80\x99s conversational, with a lot\xc2\xa0to say. Much of SweetSexySavage is about reclamation: taking all the shit women receive from men, shrugging, and asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about it?\xe2\x80\x9d' b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I gotta be a bitch, I\xe2\x80\x99mma be a bad one,\xe2\x80\x9d she taunts on \xe2\x80\x9cCRZY,\xe2\x80\x9d and the track isn\xe2\x80\x99t resigned but an anthem. \xe2\x80\x9cDistraction,\xe2\x80\x9d arranged like a one-woman girl group, walks the independent-woman walk by setting clear, disinterested boundaries for its come-on: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I give my all... are you down to be a distraction?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot Used to It\xe2\x80\x9d is unflinching in its fear of commitment. On \xe2\x80\x9cDo U Dirty,\xe2\x80\x9d Kehlani\xe2\x80\x99s a player and proud of it; the dreamy production makes lines like \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m cold and yet life is colder.../I could fuck you now and years later on you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be stuck just reminiscing\xe2\x80\x9d catch listeners off-guard. The bluntness is welcome\xc2\xa0in today\xe2\x80\x99s music world, full of men reveling in such scumbaggery and women exploring, in song after despairing song, codependence and the wounds it\xc2\xa0causes. Kehlani\xe2\x80\x99s adept at the latter as well; \xe2\x80\x9cEverything Is Yours\xe2\x80\x9d is a moody love song steeped in loathing. Kehlani sings \xe2\x80\x9cmy ring is yours, everything is yours,\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s just as much a confession of love as of giving up.' b""But Kehlani can be more optimistic. She told Rolling Stone\xc2\xa0that, where\xc2\xa0Cloud 19 proved \xe2\x80\x9cI can sing!\xe2\x80\x9d and\xc2\xa0You Should Be Here showed \xe2\x80\x9cI can write!,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0her new album says, \xe2\x80\x9cI can chill! And have fun!\xe2\x80\x9d The single\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUndercover,\xe2\x80\x9d for one, captures perfectly the delirious headspace of having the most disastrous and unlikely of your crushes reciprocated:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThey don't wanna see it happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Kehlani sings, \xe2\x80\x9cBut we say fuck it.\xe2\x80\x9d Refreshingly,\xc2\xa0SweetSexySavage is at its best\xc2\xa0when it\xe2\x80\x99s most exuberant,\xc2\xa0giddy in the face of haters and common sense alike."""

Full of negative space, it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of music that gets lost if it\xe2\x80\x99s competing with conversation, or street sounds, or the rush of a subway car. In this sense, these tracks are personal by design, cultivating something of a contemplative space. Some melodies on the album emerge more resolute than others\xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cSingalong\xe2\x80\x9d repeats, in vibraphone-like staccato, a sweet, optimistic phrase, and \xe2\x80\x9cSleeping Fish\xe2\x80\x9d sounds like it could be a sketch for a B-side from Huerco S.\xe2\x80\x99s recent album\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s just as likely to softly growl and hum. \xe2\x80\x9cBorg Pillow\xe2\x80\x9d is almost pure texture, quietly groaning in and out, and \xe2\x80\x9cPupil\xe2\x80\x9d sustains the same unchanging notes for its full five-and-a-half-minute duration.' b""The overall tone is generally unobtrusive, and the individual tracks often run together. To this effect, it almost seems odd that the songs have been given titles that conjure physical objects, nature, and human emotion: perhaps the most satisfying aspect of this release is its definitively non-linguistic form of expression.\xc2\xa0And yet, even if the sine wave is a distinctly unvarnished tool for music-making, Polachek\xe2\x80\x99s compositions are also stylish in their way. Minimalism is often embraced as a utilitarian salve to cultural overload\xe2\x80\x94in this case, applied as a practical break from pop music's loaded emotional structures. But the smart elegance that drives Drawing the Target, I imagine, will also map well onto the fleshier pop songs Polachek has to come."""
b'Max Richter',7.4,b'Three Worlds: Music From Woolf Works',0,b'Experimental',b'January 30 2017',"b""Max Richter's score for the narrative dance piece Woolf Works shows how the minimalist composer has become obsessed with storytelling in the later years of his career.""","b'Two years ago, the choreographer Wayne McGregor premiered \xe2\x80\x9cWoolf Works,\xe2\x80\x9d a narrative dance piece based on three Virginia Woolf novels (Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando, and The Waves) at the Royal Opera House. He enlisted Max Richter to pen an original score for over\xc2\xa0two-hour, three-act affair. The production, by and large, was polarizing, eliciting high praise and violent rebuke.\xc2\xa0The New York Times singled out\xc2\xa0Richter\xe2\x80\x99s score, which \xe2\x80\x9cfrequently veer[ed] into cinematic manipulativeness.\xe2\x80\x9d It is hard not to read this an indictment of Richter, but in reality, it highlights how his score is able to stand apart from the piece it belongs to. Now available for the first time, a slightly truncated version of Richter\xe2\x80\x99s score proves something he has been talking about quite a bit in the later years of his career: that his work is unified by an obsession with storytelling.' b'The score opens up with \xe2\x80\x9cWord,\xe2\x80\x9d the first movement in the first act (inspired by Mrs. Dalloway). The piece is composed of a chorus of bells, gongs, and sampled human bustling\xc2\xa0(the bell of Parliament\xe2\x80\x99s Elizabeth Tower, traffic in Gordon Square). Seconds later, through the haze, the only known recording of Virginia Woolf\xe2\x80\x99s voice plays. She reads a portion of the essay part of a BBC broadcast called \xe2\x80\x9cWords Fail Me,\xe2\x80\x9d waxing poetic on the ghostly nature of the English language (\xe2\x80\x9cWords, English words, are full of echoes, of memories, of associations\xe2\x80\x9d) and the impossible negotiation between private meaning and public discourse in prose writing. It is a stunning way to open the score, and gives credence to Richter\xe2\x80\x99s invisible hand shaping the narrative of the dance.' b'After the introduction, the next three pieces cleave closer to convention. Apparently, much like Dalloway, the sounds are supposed to evoke the novel\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary focus on the \xe2\x80\x9ctexture of the ordinary day,\xe2\x80\x9d and here, Richter takes that to mean something closer to rote string arrangements, where dips and dives are telegraphed like a routine ballroom dance. Some of it is quite beautiful, foregrounding his graceful piano playing. \xe2\x80\x9cWar Anthem,\xe2\x80\x9d in particular, is quite similar to some of his earlier work, like \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Nature of Daylight,\xe2\x80\x9d epic scale and all.' b""The more adventurous side of Richter is made more apparent in the dance\xe2\x80\x99s second act, based on Orlando, Woolf\xe2\x80\x99s most personal work. Inspired by the novel\xe2\x80\x99s transformational conceit, (it tells a fictional biography of a 16th-century male poet who turns into a woman, and lives till the present day) he turned to the \xe2\x80\x9cLa Folia,\xe2\x80\x9d a Portuguese folk dance so wild and noisy that it was associated with madness. Richter's singular ability to meld electronics into classical arrangements breathes life into this idea, and on pieces\xc2\xa0like the \xe2\x80\x9cThe Explorers\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cModular Astronomy,\xe2\x80\x9d he deploys electronics that are both silken and pointedly mechanical. He uses glitches, hiccups, and washes of noise to elevate pockets of lonely strings and keystrokes to heights of anachronistic beauty. Other works\xc2\xa0like \xe2\x80\x9cEntropy\xe2\x80\x9d recall the squeamish grace of Oneohtrix Point Never."" b'The score concludes with the sounds of waves lapping in the middle of the ocean, and\xc2\xa0Gillian Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s voice floats into focus, giving dramatic reading of Woolf\xe2\x80\x99s suicide letter to her husband Leonard. After almost 40 minutes of instrumental music, the introduction of an august British voice is startling. For a second, it can feel too on-the-nose (of course the section about *The Waves has waves), and maybe even manipulative to use the letter to elicit an emotional response. But, as Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s voice dissolves into the oceanic strings, the next 21 minutes build to a plaintive, melancholy peak. Richter said that his 8-hour piece Sleep\xc2\xa0*was a much easier work than Woolf Works, and it shows; he was asked to make a musical world for three vastly different novels, united by an almost private language of symbols and themes. His goal with the score was to \xe2\x80\x9cevoke the experience of jumping between languages\xe2\x80\x9d in order to mimic what Woolf so often does in her writing. Like McGregor, he set an impossible bar, and even if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t clear it, the fall leads to something arresting nonetheless.'"
b'Egyptrixx',6.7,"b'Pure, Beyond Reproach'",0,b'Electronic',b'January 30 2017',"b'On his latest as Egyptrixx, it sounds more than ever like the Toronto electronic musician is trying to burrow inside a migraine, stick contact mics to its contours, and figure out what makes it tick.'","b'It must not be easy being one of David Psutka\xe2\x80\x99s reverb units. He pushes them hard, stretching their sustain settings to extreme lengths and running heavy material through them constantly: The clang of struck sheet metal, the crash of broken windows, the dissonant peal of heavy bells. His reverb is so glassy and expansive it feels like the main attraction, not the supplementary effect. Most musicians apply reverb the way a photographer might subtly retouch an image, using it to add a sense of depth to a given sound. But in Psutka\xe2\x80\x99s hands, it comes across more like one of Madame Tussaud\xe2\x80\x99s wax sculptures\xe2\x80\x94an eerie, distended facsimile immobilized under a spotlight, a frozen echo deep in the uncanny valley.' b'Where Psutka\xe2\x80\x99s first two records hewed to the jagged blueprint proposed by his Night Slugs peers, his recent work has been getting more and more abstract, downplaying club music\xe2\x80\x99s beats in favor of an all-encompassing throb. On his latest album as Egyptrixx, his main alias, it sounds more than ever like the Toronto electronic musician is trying to burrow inside a migraine, stick contact mics to its contours, and figure out just what makes it tick. It is a heaving mass of ringing copper and seasick frequencies. Not only is it free of anything you might classify as a melody; even its basslines are reduced to an ominous rumble, and its glancing riffs feel as accidental as wind chimes.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a long way away from the prickly, technoid pulse of tunes like \xe2\x80\x9cA/B Til Infinity\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0or \xe2\x80\x9cBible Eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d which variously explored John Carpenter synths and the loping beats of UK funky. But it makes for a logical next step from his last album as Egyptrixx, 2015\xe2\x80\x99s doomy Transfer of Energy (Feelings of Power), and it comes even closer in spirit to a record that he released last year under his Ceramic TL alias, Sign of the Cross Every Mile to the Border. That album, a mostly ambient exploration of held bell tones and granular delay, had the bitter reek of an electrical fire, and this record replicates those noxious atmospheres and reintroduces beats: thudding kick drums, zippering hi-hats, and the incessant din of battered metal. His scrap-heap percussion often has more in common with Einst\xc3\xbcrzende Neubauten than it does club music peers like Bok Bok or Jam City.' b'Despite the heaviness, the bell tones\xe2\x80\x99 broad, spectral sweep infuses the music with a rich, burnished glow, and the presence of vocoders and chiming FM synths only adds to the luminous air. The album opens with the sound of running water, and that sound recurs throughout the record, bubbling up like a hot spring and offering a soothing counterpoint to the omnipresent violence. The mood is jarring and gentle all at once, battering the listener with car-crash frequencies and then offering sweeter sounds as a kind of balm. It\xe2\x80\x99s a disorienting listen: His arrangements are as murky as a flooded catacombs, and the way that arpeggiated bell tones and other motifs recur in nearly identical forms across the album, it can be easy to feel marooned amidst its swirl, and the claustrophobic sameness of his sound design verges on the suffocating.' b'Presumably this is all part of the point. Taking inspiration from the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s burgeoning quantities of plastic flotsam and jetsam, Psutka describes the album\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic as \xe2\x80\x9cpacific litter clank; chill torrents and artificial triumphalism.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s definitely nailed the vibe: The music drifts in a great, heaving mass, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, and it\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful and monstrous all at once. It really does sound like a ton of plastic shifting its weight around: Dumping a tub of my kid\xe2\x80\x99s Legos on the floor, I was immediately struck by the sonic similarity to Egyptrixx\xe2\x80\x99s palette. There\xe2\x80\x99s simply too much of it, though. What feels bracingly alien for the first five or six tracks turns into a hard slog by the tenth; it would have been far effective to shut things down after \xe2\x80\x9cPlastic Pebble [beat],\xe2\x80\x9d a climactic mixture of grime synths, trap hi-hats, and the dissonant clang of EVOL-era Sonic Youth. That was a problem on Psutka\xe2\x80\x99s last couple of albums, too; his concepts are stronger than his editing skills. Still, taken in moderate doses, it\xe2\x80\x99s a strangely moving portrait of ecological collapse translated into sound.'"
b'Various Artists',7.2,b'Dreamy Harbor',0,,b'January 30 2017',"b'This twelve-track compilation celebrates the German label Tresor, a vital point in the Detroit-Berlin techno axis. Drexciya,\xc2\xa0Donato Dozzy, Jon Hassell, and others contribute.'","b'When Dimitri Hegemann set up an art space in the vaults under the Wertheim department store in East Berlin in the spring of 1991, it seemed unlikely that it\xc2\xa0would last out the initial\xc2\xa0three-month lease. But the club Tresor became a vital point on the Detroit-Berlin axis in the early \xe2\x80\x9990s, its lease was extended, and the underground club became a conduit that brought the first practitioners of techno over to Europe, introducing the likes of Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, and more to the continent, which in turn helped it become a worldwide force. The club has always been a more vital catalyst than the label of the same name, established the same year. But its heaviest releases\xe2\x80\x94Robert Hood\xe2\x80\x99s Internal Empire, Surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s Basictonalvocabulary, Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s Harnessed the Storm, X-102\xe2\x80\x99s Discovers The Rings Of Saturn, for starters\xe2\x80\x94have maintained its international status.' b'While perhaps no longer at the cutting edge, twenty-five years in Tresor continues to stay relevant, tapping newcomers like Objekt and providing a home for the likes of Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s Terrence Dixon. To help celebrate, the label presents Dreamy Harbor, a twelve-track assortment of older artists that helped establish the label, a few newcomers from the far corners of the globe, as well as a legendary composer not previously associated with the label. Veering from woozy ambience to clanging techno and back, it shows the label to be in a transitional space of sorts.' b'One of the first surprises is the opening track, Vainquer\xe2\x80\x99s now-legendary \xe2\x80\x9cSolanus (Extracted 2).\xe2\x80\x9d Originally a B-side on the Chain Reaction label, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the defining beatless dubs to drift out in the mid-90s. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit difficult to tell just how much has been tweaked on this version from\xc2\xa0the original. Those chords that mimic exhalations from the void; that sense of serenity cut with the prickly buzz of cicadas\xe2\x80\x94it remains intact here, save that its ethereal nod now lasts a precious three minutes longer.' b'It segues into a track from newcomer Shao, who released his first single on Tresor in 2015. Shao\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSensi (edit)\xe2\x80\x9d fidgets and slowly ratchets up a sense of dread on the track, but at times it feels like an echo of the old Tresor sound. Donato Dozzy, a longtime master of such chasm-like techno in Italy, also recalls that type of sound but with more nuanced results.\xc2\xa0Where the set fares best is in breaking from the merciless sound of techno and having its artists worm into the spaces between the\xc2\xa0beats. Recent signee Marcelus lets live, loose-metered drums skitter beneath the floorboards of the haunting \xe2\x80\x9cOdawah Jam.\xe2\x80\x9d Newcomer Claudia Anderson gives \xe2\x80\x9cPhase\xe2\x80\x9d a buoyant stutter step, and Terrence Dixon slips in some saxophone breaths and a beat that seems to just gathering loose marimba tone bars together like firewood.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the shortest track on the comp, but the haunting voices that float across the spine-tingling keys of \xe2\x80\x9cDirection Asymmetry,\xe2\x80\x9d from Gerald Donald\xe2\x80\x99s post-Drexciya project, Daughter Produkt, might be the most affecting, sure to pique Drexicya fans wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s to come. Most curious is the inclusion of fourth-world composer (and Brian Eno compatriot) Jon Hassell to the mix. Recently, Hassell\xe2\x80\x99s groundbreaking work has been getting a long overdue reassessment, and more and more new artists are drawing on his reimagining (and inverting) of indigenous and ambient sounds for their own work. Hassell\xe2\x80\x99s piece is the odd one\xc2\xa0out here, but its flickering electronics and gorgeous piano and trumpet twinkle like lights on the far shore. Hopefully it hints at more work from Hassell to see light on the label in the near future. Dreamy Harbor might not be as handy or invigorating a comp as some of Tresor\xe2\x80\x99s mid-90s sets, but it\xe2\x80\x99s that rare release on the imprint that finds greater effect coming from the dreamier side of its telltale sound.'"

Combining Oscar Wilde-ian wit, compositional and lyrical sophistication that harkened back to Cole Porter and No\xc3\xabl Coward, sartorial style that split the difference between uptown chic (singer Neil Tennant) and downtown rough trade (keyboardist Chris Lowe), and a command of \xe2\x80\x9980s club music that soon proved itself far more comprehensive than most of their contemporaries, this North England-raised/London-based synthpop duo aestheticized gay life long before Tennant came out in 1994. Every LGBT person knew exactly what the pair meant in the chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s A Sin,\xe2\x80\x9d arguably the angriest and certainly most overtly anti-Catholic chorus ever to top the UK pop chart and reach the U.S. Top 10:' b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverything I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done\nEverything I ever do\nEvery place I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been\nEverywhere I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sin\xe2\x80\x9d' b'But after becoming one of the most internationally prominent acts of the \xe2\x80\x9980s with hits like their UK/U.S. #1 \xe2\x80\x9cWest End Girls,\xe2\x80\x9d Tennant and Lowe entered the \xe2\x80\x9990s knowing their \xe2\x80\x9cimperial phase\xe2\x80\x9d of uninterrupted success was over: Setting \xe2\x80\x9cCh\xc3\xa9 Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat,\xe2\x80\x9d their quintessential manifesto \xe2\x80\x9cLeft to My Own Devices\xe2\x80\x9d stalled at #84 on Billboard\xe2\x80\x99s pop chart in late \xe2\x80\x9988; their \xe2\x80\x9989 collaboration with Liza Minnelli, Results, pretty much flopped in North America beyond gay dancefloors, and the \xe2\x80\x9990 comeback they helped helm for Dusty Springfield, Reputation, didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a U.S. release\xe2\x80\x94despite all of them doing quite well in the UK.' b'Following these alternately sunny and frosty records, they released their decidedly autumnal fourth album Behaviour\xc2\xa0in the fall of 1990. Like the Cure\xe2\x80\x99s Disintegration, Depeche Mode\xe2\x80\x99s Violator, and George Michael\xe2\x80\x99s *Listen Without Prejudice, *it\xc2\xa0would transition their creators into the new decade by both refining and breaking from the past. The time was right, for the duo and indeed much of its following were now in mourning. Singer/lyricist Tennant\xe2\x80\x99s longtime best friend had recently died of AIDS. So had\xc2\xa0Robert Mapplethorpe, who shot some of their Please-period publicity photos, and Keith Haring, who similarly intersected fine art and the club scene. Reported U.S. AIDS cases were well over 100,000, with millions on the way globally, and despite the earliest AIDS drugs like AZT, which in those days often made people sicker, an HIV-positive test result was still pretty much a death sentence. Created in resistance to a mainstream that treated LGBTs as subhuman, the queer culture of defiance and liberation that shaped \xe2\x80\x9970s disco and much of \xe2\x80\x9980s pop\xe2\x80\x94particularly PSB\xe2\x80\x99s hybrid of both\xe2\x80\x94was literally dying.' b'Unfolding like an elegy for much of what had gone before, Behaviour shifted the Boys from sly commentators to reserved-but-pained participants, with its understated but devastating lead track, \xe2\x80\x9cBeing Boring.\xe2\x80\x9d The first verse presents the singer looking through keepsakes, as one does after losing a loved one. He finds a party invite paraphrasing\xc2\xa0Zelda Fitzgerald\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEulogy on the Flapper,\xe2\x80\x9d specifically the line \xe2\x80\x9cShe refused to be bored chiefly because she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t boring.\xe2\x80\x9d Boredom was a prickly subject for the pair: Their early deadpan videos and TV appearances were routinely dismissed by clueless critics as generating it.' b'Set in the \xe2\x80\x9970s, the next verse depicts the singer leaving his hometown, a mandatory rite of LGBT passage. He softly declares, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d bolted through a closing door,\xe2\x80\x9d an image evoking both the end of his closeted adolescence and the beginning of fully realized adulthood. By the third verse, which is set in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, the singer is self-actualized, but reflective: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the people I was kissing/Some are here, and some are missing.\xe2\x80\x9d That simple rhyme still reduces gay men who lived through this era to tears, for AIDS had sorted our intimates into these two categories\xe2\x80\x94those who died young, and those who might soon follow suit, including ourselves. If you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen your gay neighbors and friends and former sexual partners around town, chances were they were dead, had gone home to die, or were nursing the dying just like you. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I thought in spite of dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d the survivor sings of his fallen pal, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting somewhere here with me.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Fashion photographer Bruce Weber shot the song\xe2\x80\x99s lush B&W video, which features models enacting a fantasy version of the parties Tennant attended in the \xe2\x80\x9970s. The tension between the freedom of Weber\xe2\x80\x99s imagery and the sadness of the third verse makes the eulogy even more devastating, but some fleeting nudity meant that MTV in America had an excuse not to show it. Still, \xe2\x80\x9cBeing Boring\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94ostensibly a dance track, but one featuring fluttering rhythms, a Larry Heard-style deep house bassline that appears only as the album version fades out, a subtle upward chorus modulation that adds sweetness to the sorrow, and a whirring plastic tube conjuring spectral cries\xe2\x80\x94eventually earned its rightful acclaim. A fan site solely devoted to it dwarfs the official web presence of many bands, and on its 20th anniversary, a Guardian critic proclaimed it the greatest single of all time. Even Axl Rose allegedly bemoaned its non-appearance during the duo\xe2\x80\x99s 1991 tour.' b'That tour, Performance, their first in North America, transformed the staginess of their videos into opulent theater just as Blonde Ambition did for Madonna the year before; in the Pets\xe2\x80\x99 case, it was so over-budget that the well-attended\xc2\xa0trek still lost half-a-million dollars. And just as the autobiographical Like a Prayer fed Blonde Ambition, the personal nature of Behaviour lent Performance pathos. The dirge that opened the show, \xe2\x80\x9cThis Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave,\xe2\x80\x9d affirmed that, like Madonna, Tennant suffered major Catholic damage. The tune is hummable, but the tone intersects opera and Joy Division as it evokes Catholic mass, freezing rain, and grey architecture. No wonder the Pets eschewed the church for wit and disco.' b'True to their queer sensibility, PSB are intrinsically contrary, even with themselves, and just as their previous release, 1988\xe2\x80\x99s Introspective, is all 12\xe2\x80\x9d-length dance numbers, Behaviour is mostly ballads. Even on overt club cuts, its lead single \xe2\x80\x9cSo Hard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of the World,\xe2\x80\x9d the dance grooves that defined the duo are muted: No more big \xe2\x80\x9980s drums, no electro rumble or hi-NRG clatter, even if \xe2\x80\x9cSo Hard\xe2\x80\x9d ramps up the trademark orchestral blasts of their previous hits. Rather than the sample-heavy rave bleeps that ruled 1990 UK pop, the album favors analogue synths overseen by co-producer Harold Faltermeyer, the Munich synth whiz who\xe2\x80\x99d been Giorgio Moroder\xe2\x80\x99s key player and had scored with Beverly Hills Cop\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cAxel F.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""But though the instrumentation is mostly as synthetic as before, it\xe2\x80\x99s less pointedly so; the future was no longer as inviting as it had been in the duo\xe2\x80\x99s formative years, when they dreamt of man-machines and home computers. Embracing their humanism to mirror their messages, the pair often blur\xc2\xa0the boundaries between synthetic and natural sounds: Mirroring the instability of post-communist Russia, \xe2\x80\x9cMy October Symphony\xe2\x80\x9d fuses banging Italo-house piano, \xe2\x80\x9cFunky Drummer\xe2\x80\x9d syncopation, Marvin Gaye-esque yearning, and the classical strings of Balanescu Quartet, which all blend with the Prophets and Rolands and Marr\xe2\x80\x99s wah-wah guitar so seamlessly that the hybrid suggests Shostakovich going Blaxploitation. You certainly couldn't\xc2\xa0call it just \xe2\x80\x9csynthpop.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b'In the booklet for the album\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 deluxe reissue, Tennant paints the unabashed love aria \xe2\x80\x9cTo Face the Truth\xe2\x80\x9d as the story of a man who cannot acknowledge his girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s infidelities. But like so many PSB songs, it makes more sense in an LGBT context; that his lover is a bisexual who dodges their emotional bond. Having same-gender sex dictates that you\xe2\x80\x99re homosexual, but loving someone of your own gender makes you gay\xe2\x80\x94a step too far for some. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if you care and cannot bear the proof/It hurts too much to face the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d Tennant croons at the top of his tenor. Having just worked with Liza and Dusty, he\xe2\x80\x99d suddenly become a more expressive singer, one here as adept at conveying sincerity as he\xe2\x80\x99d always been at generating irony. The programmed rhythms hail from \xe2\x80\x9980s R&B, but his vocal is \xe2\x80\x9970s Bee Gees; had this been on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, we\xe2\x80\x99d all know it.' b'Lyrically the most old-school PSB-y song of the lot, \xe2\x80\x9cHow Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?\xe2\x80\x9d roasts sanctimonious rock stars who claim to hate fame\xe2\x80\x99s machinations but nevertheless align themselves with the trendiest causes. There\xe2\x80\x99d been plenty of those in the wake of Band Aid, Live Aid, Farm Aid, and \xe2\x80\x9cWe Are the World,\xe2\x80\x9d and they pretty much wiped out the more subversive and often queer \xe2\x80\x9cNew Pop\xe2\x80\x9d movement that spawned the Pets. The album version is set atypically to a New Jack Swing beat, the kind that gave even Boy George a US R&B radio hit with \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Take My Mind on a Trip\xe2\x80\x9d the year before, but the seldom heard single/video version remixed it into a more flattering Soul II Soul-style shuffle. Back home, its critique was bolstered by appearing on the flipside of their newly recorded medley of U2\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWhere the Streets Have No Name\xe2\x80\x9d and the Four Seasons\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Take My Eyes Off of You,\xe2\x80\x9d which echoed Boys Town Gang\xe2\x80\x99s shamelessly camp disco-ization of the latter. Bono, who spotted the satirical finger being pointed in his direction, quipped, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have we done to deserve this?\xe2\x80\x9d' b'As straightforward as \xe2\x80\x9cSeriously\xe2\x80\x9d is skewed, album closer \xe2\x80\x9cJealousy\xe2\x80\x9d goes furthest in a quasi-symphonic direction. Played on keyboards but booming like a massive orchestra, it\xe2\x80\x99s fraught with romantic angst like their earliest work, yet it suits their new phase of unfettered emotionality. The scene-setting opening conjures the outsized ardor of 19th-century\xc2\xa0art song: \xe2\x80\x9cAt dead of night when strangers roam/The streets in search of anyone who\xe2\x80\x99ll take them home/I lie alone\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d And the rest similarly picks up where Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s covers of Jacques Brel left off.' b'A crooner, not a belter, Tennant sets his vocal understatement against the over-the-top nature of his blinding passion for an unrequited love. This conflict mirrors the LGBT experience itself: You\xe2\x80\x99ve got all this desire that must\xc2\xa0somehow be contained to\xc2\xa0a small percentage of the population, lest you find yourself making a pass at someone who might not share your sexuality and who might respond with condemnation or even\xc2\xa0violence. So you keep your outer voice small and whispery like Tennant\xe2\x80\x99s, but that constant monitoring and muting only intensifies your inner life, and so you bear\xc2\xa0the burden of these feelings\xe2\x80\x94here represented by the grandness of the orchestration, the despair of the descending vocal melody, the processional horns that bear a stubbornly regal retreat. There\xe2\x80\x99s no apology implied\xe2\x80\x94quite the opposite.' b'Simpatico women understand this proud juxtaposition: Liza Minnelli considers Tennant and Lowe geniuses akin to Broadway maestro Stephen Sondheim or her dad. Pet Shop Boys critique masculinity the way classic rock bands exude it, but rather than the flamboyance that\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic to the gay pop star from Little Richard onward, PSB offer the calm control of the outsider looking in, their noses pressed against the shop window.' b'Having experienced worldwide eminence exactly when their people fell into deeper crisis than ever, they rarely took the\xc2\xa0easy path, and on subsequent releases like Very\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDreaming of the Queen,\xe2\x80\x9d they imagined a world in which there were no more lovers left alive. Fortunately, people kept dancing, and Pet Shop Boys still supply their nocturnal soundtrack. Last month, Billboard announced PSB as the all-time top male act on its dance club chart: With last year\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pop Kids,\xe2\x80\x9d they landed their 40th hit on that list in 30 years, and 11th No. 1. That they did so with a song as wistful as those on Behaviour makes this achievement truly singular. Embracing disposable pop, they\xe2\x80\x99ve created lasting queer culture just as it was in danger of disappearing. They celebrate the melancholia of being gay.'"
"b""Tomorrow's People""",6.8,b'Open Soul',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'January 28 2017',"b'The latest from\xc2\xa0Melodies International, the reissues label by Floating Points\xe2\x80\x99 Sam Shepherd, is the 1976 LP\xc2\xa0from Chicago soul-disco band\xc2\xa0Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s People\xe2\x80\x94featuring an audacious 20-minute title track.'","b'When he\xe2\x80\x99s not touring as Floating Points, Sam Shepherd also DJs a funk and soul party, called You\xe2\x80\x99re a Melody. His selections skew\xc2\xa0ludicrously rare, and for most DJs, just flashing them before the trainspotters is enough. But Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s love of the music led him to start up Melodies International, a reissues label run\xc2\xa0in tandem with DJ Love on the Run, Mafalda, and Javybz. They\xc2\xa0suss out, lovingly remaster, and (legitimately) reissue long-lost singles for a new generation of fans, from a $500 7\xe2\x80\x9d to the complete recorded works of the woefully obscure Detroit band Aged in Harmony, housed in a picture sleeve with an accompanying newsprint fanzine. This\xc2\xa0level of care and dedication towards the physical artifact is rare in an increasingly streaming-only world. And while such speculation over\xc2\xa0old records typically benefits only the seller, the profits from these reissues wind up going back to the original artist themselves.' b'For the third release on the imprint, Shepherd went beyond, reissuing the lone full-length from Chicago soul-disco group Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s People. Comprised of four brothers (Kevin, Maurice, Gerald, and Timothy Burton), their 1976 album Open Soul may not have sold many copies on the short-lived Stage Productions label, but since then it\xe2\x80\x99s become a true \xe2\x80\x9choly grail,\xe2\x80\x9d with copies in the last year changing hands for over $1,500. With the master tapes lost 20\xc2\xa0years ago, the label set about reissuing the LP\xc2\xa0sourced from multiple copies of the original album. Alas, the foxy cover of the original is now replaced with a drawing of the four brothers.' b'For those not taken with the rarefied stratosphere of private press funk and soul albums, the first half of\xc2\xa0Open Soul might leave you wondering what the fuss is all about. \xe2\x80\x9cLovers to Friends\xe2\x80\x9d is a slow-burner featuring the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 effortless harmonies, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not too much that would have made it stand\xc2\xa0out during that decade. \xe2\x80\x9cIt Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Fair\xe2\x80\x9d continues along at nearly the same tempo, with a bit more eerie analog synth and a saxophone line drifting across as the brothers coo \xe2\x80\x9cooooh, don\xe2\x80\x99t take your love away.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a soulful plea, but unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve worn out the Gamble & Huff discography, there\xe2\x80\x99s more immediately rewarding fare to be had there. More upbeat is \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Get Down With the Beat,\xe2\x80\x9d which features the kind of proto-disco beat and cymbal work that Earl Young pioneered during those years. The fidgety instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cHurt Perversion\xe2\x80\x9d puts the keyboards front and center\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous of Bernie Worrell and his key work with Funkadelic, and\xc2\xa0not nearly as wigged out.' b'No matter how rare the album might be, no one is paying a month of New York City rent for the first five songs of Open Soul. And no one pleaded during a You\xe2\x80\x99re a Melody DJ set for this album to be made available again (based on the A-side). But flip it over and you\xe2\x80\x99re presented with the stunning 20-minute title track. Brother Timothy\xe2\x80\x99s spare organ work and Brother Gerald\xe2\x80\x99s guitar cast a spell, and for the first minute, you might think you\xe2\x80\x99re in for a beatless cosmic soul trip. Just as the two-minute mark approaches, though, that guitar tightens up, a conga drum flares to life, and \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Soul\xe2\x80\x9d bursts into full flame. \xe2\x80\x9cSoul.../Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s asking me what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d the brothers chant as the drums and hand percussion run at double time.' b'Like any good writer, in providing an answer, they show rather than tell. \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Soul\xe2\x80\x9d soon moves\xc2\xa0into a psychedelic break, with each successive electric guitar solo and sax squall nudging\xc2\xa0the temperature up a few more degrees. Seven minutes in, the brothers\xe2\x80\x99 harmonies return, and it seems that surely the song will begin to lose steam or focus. But the Burtons keep that momentum going (and going). And while the song never veers off the path of funk, in its tirelessness and doggedness it starts to mutate and resemble a motorik groove, seeming like it might forever run to the horizon.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s examples of such audacity in African-American music of that time\xe2\x80\x94Funkadelic\xe2\x80\x99s double-digit explorations, the unreleased J.B.\xe2\x80\x99s album, and Norman Whitfield\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious productions for the Temptations immediately spring to mind\xe2\x80\x94but none are as determined and downright exhaustive as \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Soul.\xe2\x80\x9d By the time that final drum roll comes around some 17\xc2\xa0minutes in, it feels like a marathon runner collapsing at the end of a race and the song recedes back to its soul ambient opening. The song no doubt wore down even the most fervent of dancers during Shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s DJ sets. And thanks to his due diligence, now it can perform a similar feat in your living room.'"
b'Delicate Steve',7.3,b'This Is Steve',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'January 28 2017',"b'On his latest, guitarist Delicate Steve seems interested in animating rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll\xe2\x80\x99s most outrageous qualities, using his studio savvy to make it do all the things it can\xe2\x80\x99t in real life.'","b'Over the past six years, Steve Marion has become something you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know you even needed in this day and age: a guitar hero. And\xc2\xa0just as contemporary superhero franchise reboots tend to focus less on their protagonists\xe2\x80\x99 powers and more on their flaws, Marion\xc2\xa0wields his ample talent with the humility of a mortal. On the (mostly) instrumental albums he\xe2\x80\x99s released as Delicate Steve, Marion\xe2\x80\x99s guitar playing is always in the spotlight, but never hogging it\xe2\x80\x94rather, his luminous leads form the emotional undercurrent around which everything else flows. What makes Marion a guitar hero isn\xe2\x80\x99t his technical wizardry, but his music\xe2\x80\x99s mission to help you through dark times.' b'The home-brewed Afro-psych soundscapes of Marion\xe2\x80\x99s previous releases made him a natural collaborator with contemporaries mining similar terrain, like Yeasayer and\xc2\xa0Dirty Projectors. Last year, he received the ultimate endorsement when he was invited to play on the latest album from the patron saint of worldly pop experimentation, Paul Simon. Though he makes primarily instrumental music, Marion\xe2\x80\x99s never been shy about using his titles to telegraph\xc2\xa0his aesthetic, be it the Stevie salute of 2011\xe2\x80\x99s Wondervisions or the nod to Sly Stone\xe2\x80\x99s lo-fi funk masterwork There\xe2\x80\x99s a Riot Goin\xe2\x80\x99 On in \xe2\x80\x9cAfria Talks to You\xe2\x80\x9d (from 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Positive Force). The track list to his new album, This Is Steve, features no such obvious call-outs, but one song title suggests a doozy of a defining statement: \xe2\x80\x9cCartoon Rock.\xe2\x80\x9d This time out, Marion is less interested in rendering his inner visions than in animating rock \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 roll\xe2\x80\x99s most outrageous qualities, using his studio savvy to make it do all the things it can\xe2\x80\x99t in real life.' b'This Is Steve may share its predecessors\xe2\x80\x99 hermetic, self-made M.O.\xc2\xa0(with Marion once again performing all the instruments himself), but it\xe2\x80\x99s the first Delicate Steve album that feels like it was designed to be performed in front of a crowd\xe2\x80\x94and an inebriated one at that. The pan-cultural influences and meditative quality that permeated his previous records have given way to more carefree kicks: southern-rock choogle, country-funk fusion, and new-wave spazziness. They\xe2\x80\x99re the sort of hazardous materials that, in less capable hands, could easily degenerate into schticky clich\xc3\xa9. But Marion handles them with the same craft and sensitivity he approached his previous, more contemplative records, translating the cheeky into the charming.' b'The aforementioned \xe2\x80\x9cCartoon Rock\xe2\x80\x9d is a case in point: what begins as an exercise in Eliminator-era ZZ Top robo-boogie eventually gives way to a joyous synth-pop coda that sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s being performed through a CalecoVision. Likewise, on the opening \xe2\x80\x9cAnimals,\xe2\x80\x9d Marion revs up a greasy slide refrain in anticipation of an explosive rock-out eruption; instead, at the expected moment of detonation, it dissolves into a celestial disco daydream. In essence, the song plays out like an alternate-universe version of the 1979 Disco Demolition in Comiskey Park, where instead of blowing up Saturday Night Fever LPs, the raging long-haired ruffians storming the field suddenly break into the hustle.' b'Marion\xe2\x80\x99s previous records occasionally used vocals for textural effect, but here, he lets his guitar do all the singing. And in light of This Is Steve\xe2\x80\x99s more irreverent approach, those George Harrison-styled leads play an ever more crucial role. They invest otherwise frivolous tunes\xe2\x80\x94like the murky\xc2\xa0boombox reggae of \xe2\x80\x9cNightlife\xe2\x80\x9d and the fidgety, synth-buzzed \xe2\x80\x9cTogether\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with unexpected pangs of poignancy, while on centerpiece track \xe2\x80\x9cHelp,\xe2\x80\x9d he fashions a \xe2\x80\x9cMy Sweet Lord\xe2\x80\x9d for atheists, its chirpy, cloud-parting guitar melody grounded by a gritty acoustic groove.' b'But Marion is also conscious of not overusing his string-bending skills for emotionally manipulative effect: one of the album\xe2\x80\x99s most moving moments comes during the nocturnal reverie \xe2\x80\x9cDriving,\xe2\x80\x9d where the chilly, piano-sculpted post-rock atmospherics give way to a flurry of sunrise-summoning acoustic oscillations. Though it clocks in at just 28 minutes, This Is Steve is generously overstuffed\xe2\x80\x94with gorgeous melodies, compositional quirks, sonic details, goofy ideas, and messy feelings. But if there\xe2\x80\x99s a message Marion is trying to convey through the album\xe2\x80\x99s jammed frequencies, it\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to have a laugh\xc2\xa0while his guitar gently weeps.'"
b'Jansport J',7.6,b'p h a r a o h',0,b'Rap',b'January 28 2017',b'California producer Jansport J makes instrumental hip-hop that summons J Dilla\xe2\x80\x99s Donuts without falling in its shadow.\xc2\xa0p h a r a o\xc2\xa0h\xc2\xa0is his eighth and best album.',"b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think a lot of us heard Donuts\xc2\xa0and made it our Bible.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Talking about his excellent new album *p h a r a o\xc2\xa0h *in an interview with Bandcamp, the California producer Jansport J (aka Justin Williams) was blunt about the beat tape\xe2\x80\x99s most obvious influence. Since Dilla\xe2\x80\x99s Donuts came out, a little more than a decade ago, it has stood as both monolith and lodestar at the base camp of the beat scene. Few producers have been able to escape its shadow or avoid the microsample-strewn path it lays out. *P h a r a\xc2\xa0o h *does not seek to try.' b'But by ridding himself of the anxiety of influence, J has made the best of his eight records to date, and one of the more compelling offerings to emerge from the beat scene in recent years. He\xe2\x80\x99s absorbed and built on the lessons to be found on *Donuts *and in the work of instrumental hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s other leading lights. *P h a r a o\xc2\xa0h *was originally conceived in the midst of a New York snowstorm, and the record jumps off with eight tracks worth of diamantine blizzard beats, many of them punctuated by or predicated on the human voice. Chants, shouts, whoops and screeches fill the record to great effect creating an atmosphere of engaged protest. J explained in the same interview that the track \xe2\x80\x9cRIP Harambe\xe2\x80\x9d speaks to more to than just an assassinated zoo animal; its sharply edited music is immediately followed by a 911 dispatcher, issuing yet another report of a suspicious male. That ominous audio attends the beginning of a track called \xe2\x80\x9c12,\xe2\x80\x9d a title barely more subtle than the one N.W.A. kicked off some shit with almost thirty years ago. *P h a r a o h *is remarkably effective as an explicit political document; no lyrics necessary.' b'Williams opens up and shows his range in the records latter two thirds, starting around the tributes to classic New York rap on \xe2\x80\x9c45 Joint\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSet it Off.\xe2\x80\x9d Though Williams may mean it to signal otherwise\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s remarked several times that this is his New York record\xe2\x80\x94this section begins something of a national tour. While Williams continues to honor Gotham (check out the MC Lyte sampling on \xe2\x80\x9cBKNY\xe2\x80\x9d), he stretches beyond the city, from O.D.B.\xe2\x80\x99s shouts to Miami on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dirt II\xe2\x80\x9d all the way to California on \xe2\x80\x9cLive From the Forum \xe2\x80\x9986\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCrenshaw\xe2\x80\x9d near the album\xe2\x80\x99s back half. In allowing his beats to criss-cross the country, choosing a diverse array of samples even as he cleaves to a classicist style, he retraces the original migration of hip-hop throughout the country.' b'*Donuts *was characterized by the Detroit producer\xe2\x80\x99s rare mastery of sampling, both as technical skill and artistic expression, speaking his deathbed fears and desires through prerecorded voices. J shows a similar facility here, but this is not some covers record. On songs like \xe2\x80\x9cCrush\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCrenshaw,\xe2\x80\x9d he takes a page out of the pop-loving programming of his contemporary Knxledge, essentially cross-wiring Michael Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRock With You\xe2\x80\x9d and Luther Vandross\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cBetter Love.\xe2\x80\x9d Williams also has a knack for isolating intriguing spoken samples: one of the best tracks here is \xe2\x80\x9cIwasFeelinShortee,\xe2\x80\x9d which hands the mic over to Mos Def\xe2\x80\x99s lovelorn monologue from \xe2\x80\x9cMs. Fat Booty.\xe2\x80\x9d And he favors a diversity of approaches, as happy using a hyper-recognizable Bob James drum sample as he is veering toward the obscure.' b'A record like *P h a r a o h *makes a compelling case for Jansport J to be considered for a short list of names associated with transcendent instrumental hip-hop, a pantheon that, along with Dilla, would include Madlib, Knxledge and Oddisee, as well as pioneers like DJ Shadow and Blockhead. Though *Donuts *and Madlib\xe2\x80\x99s *Beat Konducta *series continue to loom over the scene, making it difficult to expand the genre, these artists like have continued to add depth and breadth within the boundaries already set out. *P h a r a o h *hits upon a particularly deep wellspring, exploring it with curiosity and a coherent point of view that characterizes the instrumental hip hop\xe2\x80\x99s best work. Though it barely features Williams\xe2\x80\x99s own vocals, it speaks in a passionate, warm, consistently recognizable voice.'"
b'Fufanu',7.3,b'Sports',0,b'Rock',b'January 28 2017',"b'The young Icelandic post-punk band Fufanu traffic in icy disaffection and glacier-cool synths, but their latest album hints at hearts beating beneath the veneer.'","b'Though Iceland has a fertile music scene, it has produced few international names. The ones that have emerged\xe2\x80\x94Bj\xc3\xb6rk, Sigur R\xc3\xb3s, and, uh, Of Monsters and Men\xe2\x80\x94tend to paint a picture \xc2\xa0to the outside world: A\xc2\xa0tiny nation filled with artsy, insular weirdos. Yet the scene there is bustling with all sorts of sounds: \xc2\xa0Black metal, punk rock, serrated electronic music, rap. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the chilly post-punk offered by Fufanu, Iceland\xe2\x80\x99s most exciting young band.' b'Revolving around the core duo of Hrafnkell Fl\xc3\xb3ki Kaktus Einarsson and Gu\xc3\xb0laugur Halld\xc3\xb3r Einarsson (no relation; Icelandic names use patronymics), Fufanu has grown from an experimental techno duo (then known as Captain Fufanu, when Kaktus and Gulli were just teens) into purveyors of terse, claustrophobic post-punk, injected with bleary-eyed psychedelia and dystopian electronic textures. (Live, the band expands their sound into a raging, swaggering storm, though they\xe2\x80\x99ve opted to reign it in on record thus far.) There is also a surprising amount of Britpop lurking in their DNA. Kaktus worked on Damon Albarn\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 solo release Everyday Robots; Fufanu opened for the Britpop star later that year, and for Blur at Hyde Park in 2015. Though the band understandably chafes at the focus on their connection to Albarn, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying how their echoes of late-\xe2\x80\x9990s Britpop enriches their music.' b'Sports is the group\xe2\x80\x99s sophomore LP, following quickly on the heels of their late 2015 debut\xc2\xa0Few More Days to Go.\xc2\xa0It flows more than its predecessor, and trades their debut\xe2\x80\x99s corroded guitar for glacier-cool synths and hissing electronic rhythms, both propulsive and meditative. Like many great post-punk groups before them, the band consistently sounds disaffected and removed. Lead single and standout \xe2\x80\x9cSports\xe2\x80\x9d is a terse\xc2\xa0drawl of seemingly disconnected thoughts, a masterclass in building\xc2\xa0tension. \xe2\x80\x9cBad Rockets\xe2\x80\x9d sounds like a Bond theme from an alternate timeline in which 007\xe2\x80\x99s become an ashen-faced junkie, featuring the haunting refrain \xe2\x80\x9cBad rockets hit\xe2\x80\x94rockets fly above my head.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The title\xc2\xa0Few More Days to Go\xc2\xa0was a refrain the band members would deliver to loved ones asking when they\xe2\x80\x99d return home.\xc2\xa0Sports, though brooding at first glance, celebrates the little moments of homecoming, of reunion, of pleasant daily life. Kaktus, who lives with his girlfriend in Reykjavik, sings of young but stable love throughout. \xe2\x80\x9cGoing out, with my love/Jump around like a six year old\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cSports\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cJust hold me like I\xe2\x80\x99m your fool/We\xe2\x80\x99ll sleep on the back of the new moon\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cYour Fool\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cI said something about leaving soon/It\xe2\x80\x99s drumming in my heart/And asking for restart\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cRestart.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""\xe2\x80\x9cYour Fool\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRestart\xe2\x80\x9d form the record's conclusion, and they\xe2\x80\x99re unlike anything else the band has done, vulnerable and beautiful.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disassociation and disaffection of the rest of the album suddenly makes sense in the rearview, a buildup to moments of pure, aching romanticism. They transform a solid album into something of an emotional journey, and hint strongly that beneath their low-key snarling, Fufanu have grander things on their minds."""

The song jags between pomposity and modesty, with Pink lurching between\xc2\xa0lines about \xe2\x80\x9croasting pigs on the pyre\xe2\x80\x9d and how \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xc2\xa0joke was from the heart.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Then Mering\xc2\xa0takes over on \xe2\x80\x9cDaddy, Please Give a Little Time to Me\xe2\x80\x9d against a queasy synth gurgle and a snare that cracks from a room over, all of it swaddled in a haze of reverb and echo. It\xe2\x80\x99s a peculiar song, as weirdly stilted and stylized as that of Pink, as Mering moves from a high quaver to delivering her lines like lost a Shangri-Las soliloquy.' b'In tandem, they do a hazy approximation of the early-\xe2\x80\x9980s L.A. Paisley Underground\xc2\xa0on \xe2\x80\x9cOn Another Day,\xe2\x80\x9d as if some demo from 1983 suddenly bobbed to the surface. It\xe2\x80\x99s a slow burn of a duet between the two, at times evoking X\xe2\x80\x99s John Doe and Exene Cervenka. Even though the end of the song\xc2\xa0reveals it\xe2\x80\x99s played live in front of a crowd, there remains\xc2\xa0that tactile sense of distance that Pink\xe2\x80\x99s sonics readily tap into, as if echoing not just from the past but from a parallel dimension.' b'But the clear standout of this brief collab is \xe2\x80\x9cMorning After.\xe2\x80\x9d Another strange folk-synth hybrid, Mering\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounds like Fairport Convention\xe2\x80\x99s Sandy Denny\xc2\xa0doodling around on a Moog; she stuns while barely climbing above a purr. \xe2\x80\x9cHere it comes/A cure for the night I\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting/To let you inside,\xe2\x80\x9d Mering\xc2\xa0sings of a long-anticipated love. But as the sinewaves quiver in the background, the moonlight-tinted love song turns into a vampire tale: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I saw you I knew I was cursed/I\xe2\x80\x99m the one who got bit first.\xe2\x80\x9d Short-lived as Myths may be, one hopes that Pink and Mering\xe2\x80\x94odd, kindred spirits\xe2\x80\x94have the chance\xc2\xa0to commune again.'"
b'Pinegrove',7.5,b'Elsewhere',0,b'Rock',b'January 27 2017',"b'Following 2016\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0breakout debut\xc2\xa0Cardinal, the New Jersey band Pinegrove have collected some of their best songs on a lovable new live album, with\xc2\xa0proceeds going to the Southern Poverty Law Center.'","b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to root for Pinegrove. Even before they raised more than $21,000 for Planned Parenthood and released Elsewhere\xe2\x80\x94a lovable new live album whose proceeds are being donated to the Southern Poverty Law Center\xe2\x80\x94the band seemed to be propelled entirely by positivity and goodwill. For a certain kind of listener, Pinegrove\xe2\x80\x99s music will feel like a warm hug, cozy without being cloying, eliciting a rush of memories of drinking in furnished basements and driving aimlessly through quiet streets. Frontman Evan Stephens Hall\xe2\x80\x99s voice is a strained, twangy yowl that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sounded out of place on \xe2\x80\x9990s alternative rock radio, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect vessel for communicating his vulnerable thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were laughing and crying in awe at the size of the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d he recalls in one of the band\xe2\x80\x99s most impassioned anthems. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple, near-precious thought that\xe2\x80\x99s immediately elevated with a more sobering question: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to die?\xe2\x80\x9d' b'\xe2\x80\x9cSize of the Moon\xe2\x80\x9d is the penultimate track on Elsewhere, a 30-minute offering following a banner year of touring in support of their breakout debut,\xc2\xa0Cardinal. The eight songs on the collection are not reinventions: there\xe2\x80\x99s no extended jamming, no gratuitous stage banter. But like the already-legendary video of Pinegrove\xe2\x80\x99s AudioTree set last year, *Elsewhere *seems tailor-made for introducing new fans to the band. The recordings on *Elsewhere *are, in fact, a good deal more polished than the intentionally-messy Cardinal. Nandi Rose Plunkett, who also performs as Half Waif, glides through the album with a graceful shimmer, using her keyboard to fill in gaps that might have otherwise been accentuated with feedback squalls or background noise; it\xe2\x80\x99s a crucial\xc2\xa0element\xc2\xa0in their toughening sound. On Elsewhere, all of Pinegrove\xe2\x80\x99s songs feel\xc2\xa0bigger, tighter, and more controlled, without losing the edge that made them stand out in the first place.' b'More than anything, *Elsewhere *is a testament to just how good a live band Pinegrove has become. These are mostly flawless renditions of not-so-easy-to-replicate songs. Hall\xe2\x80\x99s voice is weathered and raw, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not careless: he knows exactly which lines to shout, which to whisper, which to leave out entirely and let the audience sing. The rest of the band is similarly proficient, evolving in subtle ways that build on on their various touchstones, from the American Football layered guitars in \xe2\x80\x9cVisiting\xe2\x80\x9d through rootsier territory in \xe2\x80\x9cAngelina\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAphasia.\xe2\x80\x9d In \xe2\x80\x9cAphasia,\xe2\x80\x9d a lonesome slide guitar\xe2\x80\x94a sound that hid in the background of Cardinal, suggesting its presence without asserting itself\xe2\x80\x94comes to the forefront, highlighting the band\xe2\x80\x99s ability to evolve into a modern, alt-country act.' b'In a closing rendition of \xe2\x80\x9cNew Friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall\xe2\x80\x99s voice even resembles a young Ryan Adams, before his days of breaking hearts, when he drank like a river. What the band does next will reveal where *Elsewhere *stands in their discography\xe2\x80\x94a spirited appendix to a strong debut or a Wide Awake in America before a Joshua Tree. For now, it\xe2\x80\x99s just another dose of good karma for a band who\xc2\xa0feels\xc2\xa0like an increasingly noble cause to support.'"
b'P.O.S',7.4,"b'Chill, dummy'",0,b'Rap',b'January 27 2017',"b'Minneapolis rapper\xc2\xa0P.O.S is still all about his consciousness, and usefully motivated by anger. But on\xc2\xa0Chill,\xc2\xa0d**ummy, he embraces a freed-up feel,\xc2\xa0with some\xc2\xa0grooves you might hear in a club.'","b'Focusing on trauma has always been a central plank in P.O.S\xe2\x80\x99s artistic platform. He comes by the obsession honestly. That same instinct\xc2\xa0is a hallmark of the punk tradition, long cited as an inspiration by the Minneapolis rapper. Whether you prefer to apply sub-genre labels like \xe2\x80\x9cconscious\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbackpack\xe2\x80\x9d to the art of rhyming, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that engagement with uncomfortable concepts has been key for a rich lineage of idiosyncratic MCs (both popular and not). P.O.S has called Aesop Rock his favorite rapper; the latter\xe2\x80\x99s mix of emotional vulnerability and technical confidence is a clear influence.' b'When P.O.S approaches a mood of raw celebration, the route often runs through a hardcore group chant, premised on some opposition to the zeitgeist. This aesthetic has a way of pushing uncomplicated exuberance so deep into the background that it disappears from view. And that demotion of one of hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s most expressive, universal modes creates a tension with rap\xe2\x80\x99s mainstream, no matter the season.' b'On his last record, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s We Don\xe2\x80\x99t Even Live Here, P.O.S took shots at a wide array of then-current trends in rap. The disses were on-brand, but the synth-heavy instrumentation sounded less distinct than the punk-rap style that made 2009\xe2\x80\x99s Never Better such an energizing listen. Frivolity can be pretty easy to call out. Creating a suitably attractive alternative tends to be more difficult.' b'With Chill, dummy, P.O.S avoids retreating into the program of Never Better, while also one-upping his prior outing. His own production\xe2\x80\x94and that of his collaborators\xe2\x80\x94pushes more decisively into some grooves that you might actually hear in a club. There\xe2\x80\x99s even a hint of sensuality, thanks to the slinky, bass-heavy motif that drives \xe2\x80\x9cFaded.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s new-enough ground for P.O.S that you can hear a bit of a giggle in the mix, right after the first appearance of \xe2\x80\x9cI want your body on me.\xe2\x80\x9d Though for the balance of the track, the seduction is played for real\xe2\x80\x94Justin Vernon\xe2\x80\x99s guest vocals are some of his best, too.' b'The lyricism remains captivating throughout. Rapping from the post-op vantage of a harrowing, ultimately successful\xc2\xa0kidney transplant, P.O.S is still all about his consciousness. But his latest internal critiques prove far more interesting than his evergreen complaints about meme culture. The sometimes prideful concept of \xe2\x80\x9cstaying in your lane\xe2\x80\x9d gets a healthy kick during the chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cLanes,\xe2\x80\x9d as P.O.S wonders whether staying true to his style may have stunted his growth. (\xe2\x80\x9cI been doin my own thing so long/Or is it/I been in my own way so long.\xe2\x80\x9d) This line of thinking leads to one of the most experimental tracks P.O.S has ever created: the eight-minute-plus album finale \xe2\x80\x9csleepdrone/superposition.\xe2\x80\x9d He covers a lot of ground here, with grim, sustained synth tones as well as a Kathleen Hanna feature: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be happy to be alive,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be lucky to be alive.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Other topics include the killings of Mike Brown and Eric Garner, a general sense of futility, and the concept of \xe2\x80\x9csuperposition\xe2\x80\x9d in quantum physics. That last idea\xc2\xa0is obviously\xc2\xa0fairly complicated. But at root, it has to do with multiple, simultaneous potentials for particles of matter: a discovery with clear poetic implications for an artist focused on states of development. The track itself can become almost anything, at any time\xe2\x80\x94courtesy of pivots in rhythm and vocal cadence. In the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s as rousing as P.O.S\xe2\x80\x99s best work, even though it sounds little like anything he\xe2\x80\x99s given us before.' b'Not everything on the album works on this high level. A couple of the guest-heavy tracks (like \xe2\x80\x9cBully\xe2\x80\x9d) feel more muddled in their intent. But the overall tenor of the album has a satisfying, freed-up quality. As P.O.S raps on \xe2\x80\x9cPieces/Ruins\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cSame dude new guts/Literal and figurative lost a couple fucks.\xe2\x80\x9d And\xc2\xa0while he\xe2\x80\x99s openly experimenting with his ideal resting heart-rate, P.O.S is still usefully motivated by anger\xe2\x80\x94a reality you hear clearly on the industrial-tinged opening track \xe2\x80\x9cBorn a Snake.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s healthy to try out new patterns and engage in self-critique, but not everything needs changing.'"
b'Jefe',6.9,b'The World Is Yours',0,b'Rap',b'January 27 2017',"b'The D.C. rapper Shy Glizzy\xe2\x80\x94here rebranded as Jefe\xe2\x80\x94offers \xc2\xa0another tough-minded collection of street rap anthems, addressed to people struggling through poverty and the criminal-justice system.'","b'As Shy Glizzy, D.C. native Marquis King has become the face of the rap crew Glizzy Gang, and one of the most consistent artists in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital. He raps in a needling\xc2\xa0whine about gunfights and authority and the spaces where they intersect: neighborhood turf wars, exchanges with law enforcement, being strapped as a symbol of manhood, and using gunmanship as a means to gain control over one\xe2\x80\x99s own life, to overcome poverty and unbalanced systems. Last year, he released his most compelling work yet, Young Jefe 2, a blueprint for his particular brand of confessional tough talk, half chest-beating bravado, half emotional plea for understanding (\xe2\x80\x9cI promise you that you gon\xe2\x80\x99 feel my pain bitch\xe2\x80\x9d). The tape was the most comfortable he\xe2\x80\x99s ever been, proudly taking up the mantle of local street benefactor and willing brand ambassador for his crew. Perhaps sensing a shift, King has dropped the Shy Glizzy moniker in favor of the mixtape persona: Jefe, which is Spanish for \xe2\x80\x98boss.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just rebranding myself. Reinventing on a whole higher level,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Fader. \xe2\x80\x9cI earned the title Jefe ... From the get go I\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting on for the city.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'His first offering under the new name is an EP called The World Is Yours. The eight-track project continues to explore the same ongoing themes in King\xe2\x80\x99s music\xe2\x80\x94using success as a window through which to reflect on humbler beginnings. Its message is encapsulated in the hook on \xe2\x80\x9cLove Me\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cHow the fuck could you hate me when I came up from nothing?/I just want you to love me.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t King at the peak of his powers. When he\xe2\x80\x99s at his best, he can string several devastating phrases together to create complex models of what he\xe2\x80\x99s seeing and feeling. Here, he mostly seems content to roll leisurely through verses, as on \xe2\x80\x9cOver the Hills.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s no sense of urgency, and, outside of declaring his city a war zone, the stakes are generally lower for Jefe than they are in most Shy Glizzy songs. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the songs are without consequence. On \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations,\xe2\x80\x9d he assesses the envy of those close to his success. The cautionary tale \xe2\x80\x9cGive It Up\xe2\x80\x9d is an instruction manual for young street soldiers, ending with an inspirational testimonial, tracing a bleak journey from\xc2\xa0juvenile corrections to six-figure tours: \xe2\x80\x9c14 years old, I went to juvie for an O/16 years old, I stuck my dick in my PO/18 years old, I was whipping up the dope/ By 20 years old, I was getting 20 for a show.\xe2\x80\x9d The World Is Yours seems as much a personal memo as it is a Nas-ian aphorism.' b'For much of the EP\xe2\x80\x99s running time, Jefe provides glimpses of what can, at times, make him a truly special rapper\xe2\x80\x94as has been exhibited in the past on songs like \xe2\x80\x9cFuneral\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAwwsome.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99ll go through an entire verse only using one scheme (as he does on \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations\xe2\x80\x9d), but other times he\xe2\x80\x99ll take big cuts at syllables, at one point rhyming \xe2\x80\x9cfuck,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNew York,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMarshall Faulk.\xe2\x80\x9d Over one of the most vibrant Zaytoven beats in years, on \xe2\x80\x9cOne,\xe2\x80\x9d he mixes off-balance slant rhymes with brief moments of criminal introspection. It\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of what he\xe2\x80\x99s capable of. The World Is Yours is a fine introduction to Jefe. But it\xe2\x80\x99s still worth getting to know Shy Glizzy first.'"
b'Cloud Nothings',7.0,b'Life Without Sound',0,b'Rock',b'January 26 2017',b'Life Without Sound is\xc2\xa0the most contemplative Cloud Nothings album yet.',"b'With every album, Cloud Nothings have bailed on their past and re-shaped themselves into something more vital. Over their first three\xc2\xa0albums, Cleveland native Dylan Baldi seemed to be flooring the pedal in search of inspiration, from the lo-fi indie of singles collection\xc2\xa0Turning On\xc2\xa0to the pop-punk indebted self-titled\xc2\xa0debut to the increasingly serrated and howling peaks of Attack on Memory\xc2\xa0and Here and Nowhere Else. Somewhere in the long-gestating creation of their new album, however, Baldi stopped sprinting and briefly stalled out. Unsatisfactory demos piled up. Unproductive recording sessions and frustrations mounted, and a year of recording stretched on, the longest time Baldi had ever spent making one record. (Here and Nowhere Else was written after slamming some bad coffee and writing songs the day before.) Finally he broke through, and Life Without Sound, the result, is the most contemplative Cloud Nothings album yet.' b'This time, instead of becoming faster or more volatile, they pump the brakes and smooth out some of their more coarse edges. Baldi was inspired by the chaotic, freeform improvisations of \xc2\xa0New York composer Malcolm Goldstein, and the album boasts an open-ended, impressionist feel that\xe2\x80\x99s new for them. The quiet, almost mournful piano solo of \xe2\x80\x9cUp to the Surface\xe2\x80\x9d opens the album, and when Baldi\xe2\x80\x99s voice appears, his singing is subtle and restrained. Displaced, disoriented, and alone, he paints a portrait of fire on the horizon and a planet frozen over. The narrator of Life Without Sound has a lot of this kind of stuff in his back pocket\xe2\x80\x94poetry about isolation, desperation, self-evaluation, and trying to find a place in the world. The drama is rich, so when the lyrics temporarily fall away and the sound suddenly becomes massive, the payoff feels huge.' b'Producer John Goodmanson (whose pedigree includes records by Sleater-Kinney, Bikini Kill, Death Cab, and Unwound) recorded the band for three weeks, and in that time, he helped build moments like the climax of \xe2\x80\x9cUp to the Surface\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a big whorl of sound where TJ Duke\xe2\x80\x99s bass lines become massive, threatening to eclipse Jayson Gerycz\xe2\x80\x99s point-perfect drum fills and some dependably catchy riff work from Baldi. The album regularly oscillates between calm and upheaval, and with Goodmanson\xe2\x80\x99s help, Cloud Nothings ride valleys into peaks effortlessly.' b'Baldi\xe2\x80\x99s vocals were the final element to be recorded on the album, and he delivers his most emotionally complex performance to date. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bruised quality to his delivery on \xe2\x80\x9cSurface\xe2\x80\x9d and an assertive resolve when he sings about moving on (and looking back) on \xe2\x80\x9cEnter Entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d You can hear both confidence and fragility on \xe2\x80\x9cModern Act.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s always been good, but the album provides the best showcase for Baldi\xe2\x80\x99s voice yet.' b'The biggest knock against Life Without Sound\xc2\xa0is that it comes up short on\xc2\xa0hooks. Historically, the most powerful Cloud Nothings tracks bob and weave in search of new melodies, turning up new earworms to replace the ones from moments earlier. Look at \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Not Part of Me\xe2\x80\x9d (maybe their best song)\xe2\x80\x94each new hook somehow manages to dunk on the one that came before until the chorus reaches a shout-along fever pitch. There are scattered examples of this songwriting on Life Without Sound, but some songs just spin in place. \xe2\x80\x9cDarkened Rings\xe2\x80\x9d begins with momentum, but beyond its initial rush, it\xe2\x80\x99s short on ideas. \xe2\x80\x9cRealize My Fate\xe2\x80\x9d becomes repetitive and stagnant even when the band turns the screws on the tension. Screams, massive guitar tone, and a muscular performance, it turns out, can only go so far.' b'Baldi has called Life Without Sound the band\xe2\x80\x99s version of new age music. (Warning: Do not attempt to meditate to this loud guitar music.) The songs come with uplifting mantras (\xe2\x80\x9cfeel right, feel lighter\xe2\x80\x9d) and encourage reflection in tumultuous times (\xe2\x80\x9cI knew\xc2\xa0peace in the terror of the mind\xe2\x80\x9d). Baldi declares his intentions to move past the heaviness, though he knows full well that\xe2\x80\x99s easier said than done. \xe2\x80\x9cMoving on but I still feel it/You\xe2\x80\x99re just a light in me now,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, repeatedly, on \xe2\x80\x9cEnter Entirely.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful message, but it takes more than words to make this kind of music feel inspirational. They\xe2\x80\x99ve eased back from their most breakneck inclinations, and while Life Without Sound isn\xe2\x80\x99t their strongest work, it\xe2\x80\x99s got the seeds that could lead to their next definitive statement. History shows, anyway, that Baldi\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make the same record twice.'"
b'Mark Eitzel',8.1,b'Hey Mr Ferryman',0,b'Rock',b'January 26 2017',"b'Hey Mr Ferryman is Mark Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s heaviest album, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also, in a peculiar way, his sweetest\xe2\x80\x94like Phil Spector orchestrating a George Saunders story.'","b'So much of Mark Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s music exists in spite of itself. Sung in a husky register between a whisper and a croon, his songs are filled with characters willing themselves to disappear, transmitting from a translucent state between existence and nothingness. At the beginning of his last album, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Don\xe2\x80\x99t Be a Stranger, a woman approached Eitzel to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, but you\xe2\x80\x99re dead,\xe2\x80\x9d a six-word phrase that sums up the tension in Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s body of work, both in his seminal band American Music Club and throughout his fruitful solo career. His songs don\xe2\x80\x99t confront mortality; they drift in and out if it like subway stops.' b'So when the reaper himself comes to take Eitzel away in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Ten Years,\xe2\x80\x9d the opening number of his latest album Hey Mr Ferryman, Eitzel is not particularly bothered. As he begins his descent to the netherworld, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually more concerned that they get his drink order right: \xe2\x80\x9cSo, mister ferryman,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings over a smooth, lite-rock groove, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you party where you\xe2\x80\x99re from?\xe2\x80\x9d While Mark Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s songs have always been stately, with his moody fingerpicking standing as one of the saddest, most immediately identifiable sounds in indie rock, they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been so ornate. The eleven tracks on Hey Mr Ferryman are adorned with codas and false-endings, strings and bells, backing vocals and auxiliary percussion. If Don\xe2\x80\x99t Be a Stranger, with its stark ballads and haunting production, felt like a vulnerable return-to-form, this is the moment where the stakes heighten and the urgency increases: the Skeleton Tree to Stranger\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Push the Sky Away.' b'All the production on *Ferryman *might seem over-the-top (more than one song ends with an on-the-knees-at-the-edge-of-the-stage guitar solo), if his lyrics weren\xe2\x80\x99t so crushing. In a standout track called \xe2\x80\x9cIn My Role as a Professional Singer and Ham,\xe2\x80\x9d Eitzel wails in the chorus, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at me, I look away.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment that\xe2\x80\x99s often rung true for Eitzel. For all his years as a working songwriter\xe2\x80\x94with even a major label deal thrown in the mix for a little bit in the \xe2\x80\x9990s\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s never armed himself for a proper breakthrough: his work always felt too quiet, too insular, too strange. But on Ferryman, Eitzel is staring right back out at you. Notice in that line in \xe2\x80\x9cMy Role\xe2\x80\x9d how he holds out the second syllable of \xe2\x80\x9caway\xe2\x80\x9d to make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s got your attention (while also making the self-deprecating song title feel a little less ironic). In this context, the orchestration feels less ornamental and more like a reflection of Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s own confidence and catharsis.' b'As always, Eitzel populates *Ferryman *with a myriad of stories and characters, taking the focus off of himself and onto his word choice and the thematic links between songs. Sometimes, he takes on a literal character, like in the Joni Mitchell-style showbiz tragicomedy \xe2\x80\x9cMr Humphries\xe2\x80\x9d or the repurposed folklore of \xe2\x80\x9cLa Llorona.\xe2\x80\x9d Other times, he uses his subjects as a foil for his own fatalistic tendencies. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Answer\xe2\x80\x9d is one of Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s finest love songs and one that finds him questioning his entire belief system: \xe2\x80\x9cYou make me want to stick around and find if there\xe2\x80\x99s an answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings. It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou make me believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s an answer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s still a Mark Eitzel song, after all. But the idea that someone can open him up to the possibility of permanence feels like a revelation.' b'That sentiment forms the underlying message\xc2\xa0of Ferryman\xe2\x80\x94that optimism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily mean knowing that things will be okay, but simply having a reason to wait and find out if they could be. It\xe2\x80\x99s Eitzel\xe2\x80\x99s heaviest album, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also, in a peculiar way, his sweetest\xe2\x80\x94like Phil Spector orchestrating a George Saunders story. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that was death, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d Eitzel sings in \xe2\x80\x9cAn Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Wing Brushed the Penny Slot,\xe2\x80\x9d from the perspective of a dead woman haunting her gambling-addict widow. Visiting him in the hotel where she died, she leaves him with a pithy message: \xe2\x80\x9cThe El Cortez still welcomes me/Guess if you die on their floor, the drinks are all free.\xe2\x80\x9d After all, Eitzel implies, seeing a light at the end of the tunnel is just another way to\xc2\xa0look on the bright side.'"

It still casts a long shadow; the chain-driven turbo-fluttering hiss of \xe2\x80\x9cLa Rock 01\xe2\x80\x9d and the horror/euphoria grind of \xe2\x80\x9cPoney Part 1\xe2\x80\x9d were the early alley-oops to the monster jams of Ed Banger\xe2\x80\x99s mid-\xe2\x80\x9900s heyday. But after OK Cowboy\xc2\xa0fleshed out his geeked-out aggro electro-house and Flashmob\xc2\xa0let it grow even wilder, Rave Age\xc2\xa0*revealed the limits of his overblown attack: sooner or later, like any powerful drug, all you get from ramping up the dosage is a baseline feel of familiar getting-by normality.' b'*Voyager\xc2\xa0*comes more than a decade after *OK Cowboy *amplified Vitalic\xe2\x80\x99s thrilling role in the French Touch scene, and it feels like it. There are glimpses of the old feverish energy on the record\xe2\x80\x94Arbez can still bring the no-fucking-around 4/4 with big stompy kicks\xe2\x80\x94but to what end, it\xe2\x80\x99s never entirely clear. The one thing you could definitely expect from a Vitalic record, good or bad, was abrasion. But\xc2\xa0*Voyager\xc2\xa0*power-washes all the distortion away, leaving a\xc2\xa0shiny surface that feels anonymous in its spotlessness.' b'Without that leviathan hum, a lot of *Voyager\xe2\x80\x99*s cuts stall out at \xe2\x80\x9cmildly exciting.\xe2\x80\x9d Most of the music\xe2\x80\x99s your standard uptempo placeholder dance, detached from\xc2\xa0fleeting trends but also uninterested in finding a new niche. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like Vitalic-Goes-Synthwave would be a guaranteed improvement over the water-treading stasis of tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cLevitation\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cUse It or Lose It,\xe2\x80\x9d but it\xe2\x80\x99d at least hint at something besides an effort to carry a torch for blog house when everyone else has moved to different platforms.' b'The ostensible anthems on *Voyager *range from meaningless sincerity (the downtempo loneliness-cliche checklist \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Leave Me Now\xe2\x80\x9d) to meaningless goofiness (\xe2\x80\x9cSweet Cigarette\xe2\x80\x9d is more or less what would happen if \xe2\x80\x9cWarm Leatherette\xe2\x80\x9d was about Christopher Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThank You for Smoking\xe2\x80\x9d instead of JG Ballard\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCrash\xe2\x80\x9d).

b'Buscabulla',7.5,b'EP II',0,b'Electronic',b'January 26 2017',"b'The sound\xc2\xa0of Puerto Rican-born, NYC-based duo Buscabulla\xc2\xa0is post-chillwave but\xc2\xa0decidedly Caribbean, with nods\xc2\xa0to salsa, reggaeton, and bachata. Their\xc2\xa0sophomore\xc2\xa0EP\xc2\xa0features a duet\xc2\xa0with Helado Negro.'","b'In many ways, the Buscabulla story is indicative of the new paradigm in independent music: an indie spirit buttressed by corporate sponsorship. The Puerto Rican-born, Brooklyn-based couple of Raquel Berrios and Luis Alfredo Del Valle won a Guitar Center contest for the privilege of having Dev Hynes produce their first EP, which was recorded with help from Converse, and released by the hybrid clothing/record label Kitsun\xc3\xa9. Berrios still holds down a day job as a designer, while raising her two-year-old with Del Valle.' b'Their breaks are representative of the kind of opportunity that millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico have sought out as they\xe2\x80\x99ve left their homes on the island to pursue new lives in the states. But the exchange runs both ways. Just as NYC\xe2\x80\x99s global market and culture has shaped their lives, they help ingrain Boricua culture into America\xe2\x80\x99s, bringing the sounds and stories of the islands to mainland and, often, to English-speaking audiences.' b'You can count the recorded Buscabulla songs on two hands, and they all sound like love songs to their homeland; Berrios\xe2\x80\x99 lyrics convey a longing, distant gaze that buffers out the island\xe2\x80\x99s rough edges, a magical oasis that exists only in dreams. These themes permeate Buscabulla\xe2\x80\x99s self-released second EP, a continuation of the first, both in concept and aesthetic. \xe2\x80\x9cFr\xc3\xado\xe2\x80\x9d is\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0duet with Helado Negro\xe2\x80\x99s Roberto Carlos Lange, in which the \xe2\x80\x9cYoung, Latin, and Proud\xe2\x80\x9d singer tries to comfort\xc2\xa0Berrios\xc2\xa0as they weather the winter\xe2\x80\x99s biting cold, yearning\xc2\xa0for the warm embrace of their hometowns. \xe2\x80\x9cEl fr\xc3\xado \xc3\xa9ste duele/(Duele en tu mente),\xe2\x80\x9d they sing, or \xe2\x80\x9cThis cold hurts/(The pain is in your mind.)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPerd\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x9d considers the closure of leaving things, and people, behind. And \xe2\x80\x9cT\xc3\xa1rtaro,\xe2\x80\x9d the ode to \xe2\x80\x9csalsa erotica\xe2\x80\x9d legend Frankie Ruiz, romanticizes the island\xe2\x80\x99s seedier corners with a nostalgic fondness for sleaze that can quickly be punctured by the grimness of reality (like when the band found used towels and condom wrappers in the room they booked at an infamous Puerto Rican love hotel\xc2\xa0to shoot the video).' b'But Ruiz is an excellent analogue to the vibe that Buscabulla seeks to create. He sings about adultery and promiscuity, but with a croon that sounds too pretty to be wrong. While Buscabulla\xe2\x80\x99s live shows are considerably more high-energy than the lounge vibes on the records, they still draw from the same the sonic palette. Their aesthetic is post-chillwave but\xc2\xa0decidedly Caribbean, with percussion that skews towards salsa, and\xc2\xa0there are discernible nods to reggaeton, bachata, and even hints of Sade\xe2\x80\x99s new age soul (if she was an alto). Del Valle has admitted to being drawn to the \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar type of charm\xe2\x80\x9d of Ruiz\xe2\x80\x99s music, a kitschiness wrapped in a beautiful voice, reminding us it\xe2\x80\x99s still fun to be naughty.'"
b'Ty Segall',8.0,b'Ty Segall',0,b'Rock',b'January 25 2017',"b""Segall\xe2\x80\x99s new album feels like a sampler of what he\xe2\x80\x99s been up to in the last\xc2\xa0half-decade. It's an easy entry point into his imposing catalog, and a complete portrait of his many capabilities.""","b'Back in the \xe2\x80\x9960s, when bands like the Rolling Stones were averaging three new albums a year, they\xe2\x80\x99d also drop quickie compilations along the way\xe2\x80\x94like High Tides and Green Grass and Through the Past, Darkly\xe2\x80\x94to summarize a particularly prolific period (or just cash-in on more casual fans). As someone who aspires to a \xe2\x80\x9960s Stones ideal\xe2\x80\x94in terms of both his sheer level of output and his ever-evolving garage-rock aesthetic\xe2\x80\x94Ty Segall is also wont to drop the occasional summary collection that allows the average listener to play catch-up. Except Segall is so restless and relentless, of course, that these compilations actually comprise all new material.' b'In the fall of 2012, Segall dropped Twins, an eclectic album that took a tasting-menu approach to the three\xc2\xa0aesthetically discrete albums that immediately preceded it. Likewise, Segall\xe2\x80\x99s new album feels like a sampler of what he\xe2\x80\x99s been up to in the half-decade since: the melancholic acoustic meditations of Sleeper, the classicist craftsmanship of Manipulator, the Marc Bolan s\xc3\xa9ances of Ty Rex, the diseased, dementoid psych-punk of last year\xe2\x80\x99s Emotional Mugger. Ty Segall is the second self-titled album in his discography (after his 2008 eponymous debut), seemingly because its 10 tracks offer a complete portrait of his many capabilities. But Ty Segall is more than just an easy entry point into his imposing catalog. The new album shows Segall has not only mastered several, stylistically divergent strains of rock\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s becoming ever more adept at seamlessly stitching them together.' b'For someone with roots in a genre\xe2\x80\x94garage-punk\xe2\x80\x94that puts a premium on gritty authenticity, Segall has become increasingly fond of artifice, be it the Bolan-via-Barrett faux British accent that\xe2\x80\x99s become his default vocal tic, the silver-lipstick vamping, or his use of Emotional Mugger as a vehicle to masquerade as a surrogate band and terrorize morning news programs. And that mischievous zeal is the glue that ultimately holds this album\xe2\x80\x99s disparate pieces together, particularly when they collide in the same song. Bulldozing opener \xe2\x80\x9cBreak a Guitar\xe2\x80\x9d forges a holy communion between Big Star melody and Black Sabbath brawn, and its cocksure attitude spills over to the stripped-down follow-up, \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom,\xe2\x80\x9d a scrappy, acoustic-powered number that recalls John Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s frantic Abbey Road curio \xe2\x80\x9cPolythene Pam.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only move Segall has cribbed from the second side of that Beatles classic. \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom\xe2\x80\x9d immediately gives way to an epic sequel, \xe2\x80\x9cWarm Hands (Freedom Returned),\xe2\x80\x9d a 10-minute multi-sectional suite that ricochets between warped glam-folk, proto-metal ferocity, sneering British Invasion swagger, overdriven fuzz-punk, and a jazzy guitar jam that attempts to out-Santana the Stones\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t You Hear Me Knocking.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s the most ambitious, audacious piece of music Segall has ever produced, but he whisks through the song\xe2\x80\x99s train-like structure with such manic glee that this colossal track ultimately feels as brisk and economical as a seven-inch single.' b'Given that it\xe2\x80\x99s dropped early on in the No. 3 slot, \xe2\x80\x9cWarm Hands (Freedom Returned)\xe2\x80\x9d casts a long shadow over the rest of the album\xe2\x80\x94in its wake, even the sludgy stomper \xe2\x80\x9cThe Only One\xe2\x80\x9d and the wild, glass-smashing roadhouse rave-up \xe2\x80\x9cThank You Mr. K\xe2\x80\x9d feel a bit rote in comparison. But Segall wisely balances his most epic gestures to date with his most intimate, as Ty Segall\xe2\x80\x99s back half yields the prettiest, most pristine pop songs he\xe2\x80\x99s ever written: \xe2\x80\x9cOrange Color Queen\xe2\x80\x9d is a mash note to his girlfriend rendered in T. Rex\xe2\x80\x99s mystic-lady language; the piano-rolled \xe2\x80\x9cPapers\xe2\x80\x9d wraps the album\xe2\x80\x99s catchiest chorus around a cluttered-desk scene straight out of a late-\xe2\x80\x9960s Kinks album. And on \xe2\x80\x9cTake Care (to Comb Your Hair),\xe2\x80\x9d Segall shrewdly builds a deceptively hippy-dippy folk song into a Who-sized barrage of finger-slicing windmill strums and kit-toppling drum rolls, effortlessly bridging the troubadour and trouble-maker sides of his personality.' b'Of course, Segall can\xe2\x80\x99t help but follow up these handsomely packaged songs with \xe2\x80\x9cUntitled,\xe2\x80\x9d which is really just a four-second blurt of guitar noise that closes the album with all the subtlety of a fart let out in the most crucial moment of a wedding ceremony. But that throwaway gag nonetheless serves as a reminder of Segall\xe2\x80\x99s most essential quality: his refusal to settle. Rather than chart a typically linear course from raw to refined, Segall has constructed a discography more like a zig-zagging thrill ride liable to careen off into any direction. And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the jarring track-to-track juxtapositions or within the shape-shifting songs themselves, Ty Segall shows that, nearly a decade into the game, the only predictable thing about Segall is his ability to continually surprise.'"

She\xe2\x80\x99s already mastered a few of them: rapper-singer\xc2\xa0alchemist, hook-making\xc2\xa0savant, bittersweet ballad scribe, intergenerational R&B translator, and (much like Yachty himself) effortless transmitter of communicable joy. She\xe2\x80\x99s at her best when she fills rap cadences with R&B melodies and when her verses blend into her hooks, sometimes because the verses themselves are hooks, too. After releasing her breakout EP, Zero Gravity, in December, which showcased all of her skills in a sampler, she has quickly delivered a new 10-track mixtape called Big Trouble Little Jupiter. The tape ventures even further beyond genre limits\xe2\x80\x94moving erratically from belligerent pop trap to vintage new jack swing. What it lacks in flow and consistency, it makes up for with big transitions and sheer ambition.' b'Big Trouble Little Jupiter, billed to be \xe2\x80\x9cstarring\xe2\x80\x9d Kodie Shane, is at least loosely related to the 1986 Kurt Russell film Big Trouble in Little China. Thematically, the tape is mostly about rescuing a lover from a boring boyfriend only to lure her into a short-term, noncommittal relationship while-jet setting across the globe. (Not exactly the plot of the film, but close.)\xc2\xa0Much of Kodie Shane\xe2\x80\x99s strength lies in her ability to generate earworms out of thin air, and that\xe2\x80\x99s still in play on Big Trouble Little Jupiter, especially on cuts like \xe2\x80\x9cBe With or Without.\xe2\x80\x9d But some song\xc2\xa0drag, or never get going: Woozy opener \xe2\x80\x9c2 Minute\xe2\x80\x9d is subdued and nearly sedated. The boxy confines of the slow-trotting, En Vogue-featuring \xe2\x80\x9cYour Side\xe2\x80\x9d minimizes open space, forcing Shane to maneuver through pockets with more traditional flows. The trap screecher \xe2\x80\x9cLike a Rockstar\xe2\x80\x9d forces her to over-exert\xc2\xa0her voice. When she presses too hard, the difference is palpable.' b'The best songs on Big Trouble Little Jupiter\xc2\xa0are as soothing and infectious as her strongest work. Songs pivot dramatically from stunt anthems to emotional pleas to personal profiles. On \xe2\x80\x9cTwins,\xe2\x80\x9d she declares herself a hustler and a pimp in the lineage of Jeezy, Jay Z, and Meek Mill. Over bunched synth strings on \xe2\x80\x9cNa Na Naa,\xe2\x80\x9d she reassesses her surroundings: \xe2\x80\x9cThese niggas is my sons, but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t raise \xe2\x80\x98em like this/And these hoes they not the one, but they swear that they is.\xe2\x80\x9d Her writing is as sharp as ever, producing subtle double entendres like \xe2\x80\x9cThey all want my swag but they just can\xe2\x80\x99t grasp it\xe2\x80\x9d along with scathing reads: \xe2\x80\x9cSo keep it real with me/And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have me now cause you can\xe2\x80\x99t deal me/I know your man don\xe2\x80\x99t know you here, you know I know you babe.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s in these moments, where she examines those around her, that she invites listeners to know her.' b'Production-wise, she continues to build a rapport with longtime collaborators Matty P and D.Clax here. They have credits on every song on Big Trouble Little Jupiter, and while the songs sometimes seem to come from different decades,\xc2\xa0Shane almost always pairs them with the appropriate melody and rhythm, finding a precise balance, ripping through some and drifting through others. As they continue to work together, they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a feel for what works through trial and error, scanning the entire hip-hop/R&B spectrum in the process. Though not her best work, Big Trouble Little Jupiter showcases why Kodie Shane is one of rap\xe2\x80\x99s most promising prospects: she\xe2\x80\x99s resourceful and she\xe2\x80\x99s fearless.'"

It\xe2\x80\x99s an odd position for an emo band to be in\xe2\x80\x94perfectionism is about\xc2\xa0the exact opposite of what its devotees ask for. After all, this music thrives on unsteady vocals, careening aggression and the immediacy of desperation and epiphany. Listeners and artists tend to age fast, distancing themselves from their dearly beheld truths of two years prior. When Labor Pains dropped in 2011, today\xe2\x80\x99s conscientious scene leaders Modern Baseball and the Hotelier were still teenage pop-punk bands.\xc2\xa0Fortunately, Cordes has made the most out of the\xc2\xa0protracted wait:\xc2\xa0Brokenlegged is a rich and multifaceted emo record, exploring\xc2\xa0not only the expected moments of catharsis, but the complicated hangovers that arise in their aftermath.' b'It makes for a logical follow-up to the gnarled, strident *Profanity, *which used mewithoutYou and Pedro the Lion as both sonic and lyrical guidance in how to extricate oneself from an evangelical upbringing. Reaffirming North Carolina as home\xc2\xa0after college, Cordes described the main theme of *Brokenlegged *as, \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to figure out how to live among people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t come to the same realizations of truth as you...who just take the status quo as being the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d Whatever that meant for him during the creation of *Brokenlegged, *it\xe2\x80\x99s a loaded statement that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be interpreted a very specific way in January of 2017.

b'Cherry Glazerr',7.4,b'Apocalipstick',0,b'Rock',b'January 25 2017',"b'On their sophomore album, the Los Angeles rock trio fronted by\xc2\xa0Clementine Creevy\xc2\xa0have offered their fiercest recordings yet,\xc2\xa0full of shredding jams, furious howls, and self-aware swagger.'","b'Four years ago,\xc2\xa0Los Angeles rock outfit Cherry Glazerr began with then-15-year-old singer/guitarist Clementine Creevy recording bedroom demos under the name Clembutt. These tracks were soon discovered on Soundcloud by Burger Records co-founder Sean Bohrman, who released them as a tape titled *Papa Cremp *in 2013. Cherry Glazerr\xe2\x80\x99s lineup soon solidified with the addition of bassist Sean Redman and drummer Hannah Uribe. Around this time, Cherry Glazerr caught the eye of Saint Laurent\xe2\x80\x99s ex-creative director Hedi Slimane, who embraced Creevy as a model and muse, and enlisted the band to soundtrack his debut film and a\xc2\xa0Fall 2014 Ready-to-Wear show. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Creevy\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0work in the Amazon series \xe2\x80\x9cTransparent,\xe2\x80\x9d in which she performs in a band called Glitterish (and later Fussy Puss). By the time Cherry Glazerr released their debut LP, 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Haxel Princess, Creevy\xe2\x80\x99s reputation preceded them. All of this was done while she was in high school.' b'But Creevy has been clear that Cherry Glazerr is her\xc2\xa0primary passion and the group\xe2\x80\x99s sophomore record (and Secretly Canadian debut), Apocalipstick, confirms this more fiercely than ever. While Haxel Princess was full of goofy and relatable teenage dispatches, *Apocalipstick *shoots daggers. Now 19, Creevy sounds wizened and ready for battle\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just because she recorded \xe2\x80\x9cGiving Bad People Good Ideas\xe2\x80\x9d for Death Grips\xe2\x80\x99 Bottomless Pit. Thanks in part to the production of Joe Chiccarelli (the Strokes) and Carlos De La Garza (Bleached), Creevy and new bandmates Sasami Ashworth (keys/guitar) and Tabor Allen (drums) are a powerful rock trio. But for all this swagger, there\xe2\x80\x99s still the acknowledgement that Cherry Glazerr are \xe2\x80\x9cActing professional/When I\xe2\x80\x99m nothing but a self-conscious child.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Opener \xe2\x80\x9cTold You I\xe2\x80\x99d Be With the Guys\xe2\x80\x9d recounts Creevy\xe2\x80\x99s shift from lone wolf to supportive sister, but rather than being an anthem of empowerment, the track feels mournful as it recounts lost time. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you, I told you I\xe2\x80\x99d be with the guys,\xe2\x80\x9d she howls before doubling back into murmured regret, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know better now/Than to be with the guys.\xe2\x80\x9d Cherry Glazerr tend to see-saw between extremes of expression: Moments of softness quickly give way to fiery yowls, and one can imagine a packed house of beer-swigging\xc2\xa0fans losing their minds to it. \xe2\x80\x9cSip O\xe2\x80\x99 Poison\xe2\x80\x9d has all the furious drums of No Age. Creevy\xe2\x80\x99s voice, combined with Ashworth\xe2\x80\x99s keys, create a piercing effect like Avey Tare\xe2\x80\x99s clipped yelps on Animal Collective\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGrass.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Even the\xc2\xa0lighter tracks\xc2\xa0remain rollicking. The re-recorded \xe2\x80\x9cNurse Ratched\xe2\x80\x9d offers a brief respite after \xe2\x80\x9cSip O\xe2\x80\x99 Poison\xe2\x80\x9d with a\xc2\xa0steady, shredding\xc2\xa0jam. \xe2\x80\x9cTrash People\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMoon Dust\xe2\x80\x9d are all bubbly synths and\xc2\xa0incessant drumming__,__\xc2\xa0presenting an idea of what the Go-Go\xe2\x80\x99s could have sounded like if Kim Gordon joined their ranks. \xe2\x80\x9cNuclear Bomb\xe2\x80\x9d is perhaps Apocalipstick\xe2\x80\x99s mellowest track (you might expect it to be the more appropriately titled \xe2\x80\x9cLucid Dreams\xe2\x80\x9d). Creevy takes the sadness from \xe2\x80\x9cTold You I\xe2\x80\x99d...\xe2\x80\x9d and opens the wound even deeper, digging into the pain of loss with a scalpel and a smile.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been over 30 years since Cherie Currie of the Runaways boasted, \xe2\x80\x9cHello, world! I\xe2\x80\x99m your wild girl/I\xe2\x80\x99m your ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb!,\xe2\x80\x9d giving young women control of a provocative firecracker: themselves. All fruit-related similarities aside, Cherry Glazerr are here to offer a 2017 version of the same energy, one that is sexy, juvenile, catchy, and above all, simply great rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll. While some argue that guitar music is pass\xc3\xa9, Cherry Glazerr promise to make you remember how awesome a sick riff can be, how nostalgia can be captured in a single shred, and how anyone can start a band. Always.'"
b'Japandroids',7.1,b'Near to the Wild Heart of Life',0,b'Rock',b'January 24 2017',"b'For the most part, Near to the Wild Heart of Life sticks to the Japandroids M.O., but the end results are less enticing.'","b'Listening to Japandroids makes me think about Jenga. You have the most basic elements (guitar, drums, and vocals, in this case) delicately stacked on top of each other. The raw materials\xc2\xa0are so simple,\xc2\xa0but the more it builds in increments, the higher the stakes become; each move ratchets up the tension partly because you know the whole thing is constantly in danger of buckling under itself at any time.' b'Likewise, the best Japandroids songs are always threatening to topple over; singer/guitarist Brian King struggles to reach his highest notes, and drummer David Prowse pounds the drums frantically, like they might be running away from him. They teeter\xc2\xa0forever on a precipice\xc2\xa0separating transcendence\xc2\xa0from pure cheese\xe2\x80\x94one of their best songs turns on the cathartic refrain \xe2\x80\x9cI just wanna worry about those sunshine girls\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s sold with life-changing intensity. As a lyricist, King takes you to that precipice, invites you to look over, even gives you the smallest nudge\xe2\x80\x94and then he catches you.' b'Which is why the advance single to their latest record \xe2\x80\x9cNear to the Wild Heart of Life\xe2\x80\x9d is so disappointing. \xe2\x80\x9cNear to the Wild Heart of Life\xe2\x80\x9d is too perfect. The grit on King\xe2\x80\x99s voice is gone; the guitar is too cleanly mixed; the drums don\xe2\x80\x99t hit as hard. This is a band whose second album is literally titled Celebration Rock, but this song\xe2\x80\x99s version of a lyrical clincher\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI used to be good but now I\xe2\x80\x99m bad\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94clunks off the ear like a tennis ball against a wall.' b'For the most part, Near to the Wild Heart of Life sticks to the Japandroids M.O. King still writes about drinking, about girls, about the love-hate relationship between himself and the idea of a hometown. King claims Vancouver, although things have gotten slightly more complicated as the band has\xc2\xa0tacked between Toronto, New Orleans, and Mexico City, taking a three-year hiatus of touring beginning in 2013. This much is reflected in the rollicking autobiographical travelogue \xe2\x80\x9cNorth East South West,\xe2\x80\x9d which is one of King\xe2\x80\x99s sharpest songs on the album lyrically. But the mix is too pristine, the acoustic guitar too loud, and it lacks the bite of their best songs.' b'More disheartening is the sapping of King\xe2\x80\x99s sense of humor. He was often funny in a straightforward way, like Jonathan Richman if he weren\xe2\x80\x99t a teetotaler: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t we have anything to live for?/Well of course we do/But \xe2\x80\x98til they come true/We\xe2\x80\x99re drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d went a highlight from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Nights of Wine and Roses.\xe2\x80\x9d On \xe2\x80\x9cWet Hair\xe2\x80\x9d he gave us the magnificent\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMust get to France so we can French kiss some French girls.\xe2\x80\x9d There are no similar laugh lines on\xc2\xa0Near to the Wild Heart of Life, which relies heavily on cliches and platitudes minus the wink or the grin.' b'Take \xe2\x80\x9cArc of Bar,\xe2\x80\x9d a seven-minute story song that is the centerpiece of the record and defiantly unlike anything else in the band\xe2\x80\x99s catalog. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t build to a hearty climax, a hallmark of the band. It just lumbers around, as King places hoary clich\xc3\xa9 on top of hoary clich\xc3\xa9 about \xe2\x80\x9chustlers, whores\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe jokers doing the dealing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca mistress, to some a muse\xe2\x80\xa6for her love, I would help the devil.\xe2\x80\x9d For a band that lives by its ability to slam-dunk a moment of catharsis, this song is the ultimate heat-check.' b'The spruced up modern-rock sound of a song like \xe2\x80\x9cTrue Love and a Free Life of Free Will\xe2\x80\x9d has the hollow appeal of \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d rock and roll bands like Foo Fighters or the Black Keys. (King sounds awfully like Dave Grohl on \xe2\x80\x9cMidnight to Morning.\xe2\x80\x9d) The band that playfully riffed on Thin Lizzy or sustained one riff\xc2\xa0for five minutes while proclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cafter her/I quit girls,\xe2\x80\x9d now sounds like MOR. It\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to King\xe2\x80\x99s inherent likability and the band\xe2\x80\x99s still-effortless knack for\xc2\xa0memorable melodies that this album isn\xe2\x80\x99t as big a disappointment\xc2\xa0as it may\xc2\xa0seem. They still have the discipline to keep things at eight songs only, and they can still reel off a sparkler like \xe2\x80\x9cNo Known Drink or Drug,\xe2\x80\x9d an incandescent song that flares with the ending \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6could ever hold a candle to your love.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'King and Prowse have sustained critical and fan love for eight years now. Both seem to be comfortable in their roles as rock\xc2\xa0veterans, with a loyal fanbase, a label that allows them years between records. Who am I to begrudge artists who\xe2\x80\x99ve matured?\xc2\xa0Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s age, experience, a new record label, the inevitable artistic instinct to want to switch things up a little, but whatever the reason, Near to the Wild Heart of Life ultimately lacks the urgency of the band\xe2\x80\x99s best music. The tower hasn\xe2\x80\x99t collapsed, but it\xe2\x80\x99s starting to wobble.'"
b'Matthew Dear',7.4,b'DJ-Kicks',0,b'Electronic',b'January 24 2017',"b'Matthew Dear\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the\xc2\xa0DJ-Kicks series is his most engaging\xc2\xa0commercial mix yet. Intricately and intuitively mixed, it incorporates a handful of his own unreleased tracks.'","b'Multiple identities are common in dance music, but Matthew Dear has taken his ego-altering further than most. In the early years, his aliases\xe2\x80\x94False, Jabberjaw, and Audion, along with his real name\xe2\x80\x94served as proving grounds for subtle tweaks on a single, overarching vision of techno in which texture, groove, and hook all held equal weight. But the gulf between the different aspects of his personality has steadily widened, particularly as he has settled on two main projects situated at opposite poles. As Audion, he makes cavernous, big-room techno that trades in weaponized euphoria and supersized sensation. Under his own name, he has become a singer/songwriter of knotty, nuanced electronic pop\xe2\x80\x94the possessor of a sultry, Bowie-indebted baritone and a bandleader with the swaggering stance to match.' b'His DJ-Kicks mix is credited simply to Matthew Dear, but it actually represents a third aspect of his musical persona: the DJ. It is not his first commercial mix CD. As Audion, he recorded Fabric 27 in 2006, and as Dear, he delivered the seventh installment in Get Physical\xe2\x80\x99s Body Language series in 2008. Like those mixes, DJ-Kicks focuses heavily on the present moment: Nothing is more than two years old, with the exception of a 1980 synth-pop rarity that turns up in a newly edited form. Given the ways that dance music has changed in the past decade, there\xe2\x80\x99s a temptation to read the new mix as survey of its moment, much in the same way that Fabric 27 represented the minimal scene at its mid-\xe2\x80\x9900s peak and *Body Language Volume 7 *captured a snapshot of the EasyJet-set\xe2\x80\x94the tech-house axis of London, Berlin, and Ibiza\xe2\x80\x94at the end of the decade. But Dear\xe2\x80\x99s DJ-Kicks feels less like a cross-section of a scene or a snapshot of a moment in time than a core sample of his own idiosyncratic sensibility. There\xe2\x80\x99s more character in this mix than in the previous two; it\xe2\x80\x99s weirder and more engaging. The others could sometimes get tripped up by their own linearity, but this one is more charged, more unhinged, and riskier; it\xe2\x80\x99s also more intricately and intuitively mixed. It\xe2\x80\x99s a vision of house and techno that\xe2\x80\x99s sleazy, druggy, and disorienting\xe2\x80\x94also sneaky, whip-smart, and fun.' b'Dear\xe2\x80\x99s specialty is the controlled urgency of the peak time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely where the bulk of the set dwells: deep in the chugging, roiling murk, with blunt machine grooves stirring up melodies the color of bruise blood. He opens on a more contemplative note, though, with an elegiac solo-piano piece from Nils Frahm that launches us into a new, previously unreleased song of his own: \xe2\x80\x9cWrong With Us,\xe2\x80\x9d a bittersweet, Koze-like vocal number that neatly captures the weariness of a relationship going off the rails. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only time we\xe2\x80\x99re treated to Dear\xe2\x80\x99s singing voice in the mix, but voices actually constitute a crucial through-line. Across\xc2\xa0the set he has scattered snippets of dialogue with his friends and family\xe2\x80\x94off-the-cuff fragments, slowed to a narcotic (and largely incomprehensible) crawl, that serve as sinewy connective tissue from track to track. They lend the impression of moving through a crowded dancefloor where scraps of truncated conversations whip around your head as you move\xe2\x80\x94a kind of Nightclub of Babel.' b'While few songs here foreground sung melodies, nearly every track uses vocals as a textural or rhythmic element: the cut-up, head-turning double entendres of Markus Enochson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHot Juice Box\xe2\x80\x9d; the choppy, panned, and filtered gurgles of Kreon\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSilo Sol\xe2\x80\x9d; the booming, crowd-stoking commandments of Italojohnson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cITJ10B1.\xe2\x80\x9d As a singer, Dear has always been as interested in the heft of the voice as he is in lyrical meaning, so it makes sense that he\xe2\x80\x99d gravitate toward club cuts that work in the same way. And for listeners, his varied selections\xe2\x80\x94juggling high voices and low, rough and smooth, garbled and clean\xe2\x80\x94carve out an unusual space in between vocal and instrumental dance music. These aren\xe2\x80\x99t voices we sing along with, necessarily; they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the garish \xe2\x80\x9ctoplines\xe2\x80\x9d garnishing commercial EDM. But they add nuance and mystery, drawing you in past the stern, occasionally forbidding contours of the rhythms Dear favors\xe2\x80\x94snapping, mechanical vortexes full of sharp edges and jutting angles.' b'Dear\xe2\x80\x99s mixing is a treat. Unless you know the tracks inside and out, it\xe2\x80\x99s virtually impossible to tell where they begin and end; he favors long, careful blends, and rarely leaves a given track to play out by itself for long. His selections benefit from the hands-on style. Pay attention to the way energy pulses between two cuts running in parallel, and you imagine the motion of a pinball as it ricochets off bouncers and flippers: wildly kinetic and keenly controlled.' b'The smartly paced set switchbacks between minimalist drum tracks and deeper, more atmospheric house, and it climaxes with two\xc2\xa0previously unreleased Audion cuts and an interlude. Following the \xe2\x80\x9cFlat Eric\xe2\x80\x9d-like bassline of Soulphiction\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSky So High,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLive Breakdown\xe2\x80\x9d wipes the slate clean with an extended stretch of granular vocal processing drawn out into a gravelly fit of pique. \xe2\x80\x9cStarfucker\xe2\x80\x9d rebuilds momentum with a rolling groove and a sharply syncopated hook, and it all comes to a head with the unhinged \xe2\x80\x9cBrines,\xe2\x80\x9d an improvised modular-synth workout playing rapid-fire snare rolls off dial-tone squeal. The set\xe2\x80\x99s real highpoint, though, comes a few tracks earlier, when Dear mixes Simian Mobile Disco\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cStaring at All This Handle\xe2\x80\x9d into Pearson Sound\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cXLB,\xe2\x80\x9d one of 2016\xe2\x80\x99s biggest techno tracks. As Resident Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s No. 2 track of the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s by far the highest-profile selection in the mix, but its notoriety isn\xe2\x80\x99t the operating factor here; it\xe2\x80\x99s the way Dear plays the two tracks\xe2\x80\x99 hooks off each other.' b'Each one is considerably powerful on its own. Simian Mobile Disco\xe2\x80\x99s sounds like a Foley artist\xe2\x80\x99s thunder sheet being suddenly liquefied, as if by some arcane chemical process; Pearson Sound\xe2\x80\x99s is a barrage of neon tracers cutting through darkness. Together, they evoke an image like something out of a John Woo film\xe2\x80\x94a hail of bullets in an actual hailstorm. It\xe2\x80\x99s such an intuitive pairing that you wonder why all DJs don\xe2\x80\x99t always play these two tunes together. But it goes deeper than that. With the two descending sequences snapped into a kind of double helix formation, we\xe2\x80\x99re presented with a schema of what Dear listens for when he\xe2\x80\x99s putting together a mix: an X-ray of the structural underpinnings of his DJ sets. DJing is often characterized as an active, even athletic undertaking, whether that means rapid cross-cutting or vulgar fist-pumping. But in Dear\xe2\x80\x99s hands, it can also be a more contemplative one: a case of setting up two tracks and letting them play out in a way that allows\xc2\xa0us to hear them anew. Locked into his listening, we let his ears guide ours.'"

Two decades into his Of Montreal project, Barnes continues to average about an album a year, and far more if you count compilations and EPs. That Stephen King-like prolificacy may work for\xc2\xa0rappers who aren't concerned if you listen to their latest mixtape or wait for the next one, or guys like Robert Pollard, whose records ask almost\xc2\xa0nothing of the listener. But even Of Montreal\xe2\x80\x99s best albums don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly go down easy; they\xe2\x80\x99re a serious investment of time, energy, and patience. We all only get so much time on this earth, and we can only devote so much of it listening to Kevin Barnes. And so since False Priest Of Montreal albums have piled up like unread issues of The New Yorker on a coffee table, guilt tripping you for failing to keep up with them."" b'For those who checked out after the band\xe2\x80\x99s third consecutive Georgie Fruit album, or those who could no longer keep all of the group\xe2\x80\x99s Seussian record titles straight, here\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99ve missed: a further bottoming out, followed by a run of decent full-lengths that felt a bit like apologies for the headaches that preceded them, including a kind of folky record, a more rocking one and, last year, a semi-EDM inspired one called Innocence Reaches. While by no means one of the group\xe2\x80\x99s best records\xe2\x80\x94it probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even crack the 50th percentile\xe2\x80\x94that last album seemed to outline a promising path forward for the band: Stay relevant by engaging with contemporary sounds instead of returning to the usual Beatles/Bowie/Prince triptych. But this is Of Montreal we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been ones to follow a linear progression, so here we have their latest EP, Rune Husk, which ret-cons away the last record\xe2\x80\x99s raved-up synths. It\xe2\x80\x99s a retreat, another Of Montreal release where the standout track is the one that most sounds like Ziggy Stardust.' b""\xe2\x80\x9cStag to the Stable,\xe2\x80\x9d with its punchy, Mick Ronson-esque riff, is the EP\xe2\x80\x99s most purely fun moment, especially during a loopy bridge that riffs on one of Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 go-to themes, transformation (\xe2\x80\x9cDisappearing is eerie when you don't even care to maintain a physical form/Or give voice to the pariah plaintiff in adjudication rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d) Unfortunately, the limp tracks bookending it feel like leftovers, possibly ones that predate Innocence Reaches by quite a while. Two are low-energy psychedelic sketches in need of a hook. The third is a slightly livelier one with the same problem."" b'Credit Barnes this, though: He may have made some misguided albums, but he\xe2\x80\x99s never made a cynical one. Even on his lesser material, he digs in with gonzo determination, and that conviction can go a long way. \xe2\x80\x9cIsland Life\xe2\x80\x9d almost coasts on his vividly grotesque beat poetry alone: \xe2\x80\x9cKing Derelict outed shifty ranges and kinky drones/No fetal sex traumas without revenge, a boring execution climax of trinity maggot.\xe2\x80\x9d And when on the otherwise aimless \xe2\x80\x9cWidowsucking\xe2\x80\x9d Barnes enthuses \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m wicked \xe2\x80\x99cause I have not peaked!\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99s so confident that you truly want to give him the benefit of the doubt. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t peaked. Mostly, though, Rune Husk reaffirms what we already know: Barnes has some more good music in him, and possibly even some great music, but he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make us keep digging for it.'"
b'Trouble',6.9,b'Year in 2016',0,b'Rap',b'January 24 2017',"b'The dynamic Atlanta rapper Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s year-in-review mixtape is a smart flex, featuring collaborations with Young Thug, Fetty Wap, Quavo, and others.'","b'The Atlanta rapper Mariel Semonte Orr, aka Trouble, released his first mixtape in 2011, aligning himself with the nascent locals of Duct Tape Entertainment, a label founded by rappers from the same Edgewood Court section of East Atlanta. DTE hasn\xe2\x80\x99t launched a full-fledged star from its roster, but over the last couple years, Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s name has been popping up a bit more conspicuously. Trouble now\xc2\xa0seems like the imprint\xe2\x80\x99s best chance at a resurgence;\xc2\xa0he\xc2\xa0has been earning the attention with some of the most interesting music of his career. His latest mixtape, Year in 2016, is a hasty year-in-review project, and functions as a fan-service document as well as an\xc2\xa0open invitation to catch up.' b'In 2015, Trouble made the best of an appearance on Young Thug\xe2\x80\x99s Slime Season 2*\xc2\xa0*mixtape: He slunk\xc2\xa0into bar-trading stride with one of hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s squirrelliest vocalists and helped to slur out the \xe2\x80\x9cThief in the Night\xe2\x80\x9d hook, which propelled that\xc2\xa0banger in the first place. The appearance wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an exhaustive come-up, but it suddenly cast Trouble\xc2\xa0in a newly capable, vital light. Trouble has been nurturing that collaborative spirit for years, and he\xe2\x80\x99s become an increasingly reliable Atlanta team-player. Accordingly, *Year in 2016 *hosts enough Atlanta rappers to scan like a local studio sampler. The posse cut \xe2\x80\x9cWatchu Doin,\xe2\x80\x9d one of several here\xc2\xa0culled from Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 mixtape Skoobzilla, corners him with\xc2\xa0Quavo, Young Thug, and Skippa Da Flippa. Quavo and Trouble co-pilot a tumbling, charged-up hook; on a busy beat with some\xc2\xa0big personalities, Trouble sounds indispensable, never like an add-on. It\xe2\x80\x99s not an isolated occurrence:\xc2\xa0Trouble holds his own through a handful of other crowded tracks here, too.' b'More than ever, Trouble has opened up as a rapper, having long since retired the slow-talk flow he barked out on clunky\xc2\xa0early songs. Trouble is now more likely\xc2\xa0to channel the audacity and emotion of his bars in\xc2\xa0snappier ways. There\xe2\x80\x99s still something endearingly awkward about the way he ladles his voice: sometimes shouty and yelping, others mumbling or singing a slur.' b'Lyrically, \xe2\x80\x9cAhh Man\xe2\x80\x9d may be Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s most depressing banger ever, in which he sours a piano loop with downright gloom. He moans about not wanting to answer his phone, justifies drinking because of his father\xe2\x80\x99s health, and cops to copping pills for his grandmother in legitimate need. (\xe2\x80\x9cI guess the system just ain\xe2\x80\x99t showing no love/I got her a pack off the street though,\xe2\x80\x9d he fesses.) He contemplates his uncertainties: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I be blaming myself/For the doubt I brought down on myself.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'On \xe2\x80\x9cShe in Love Wit Trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d another solo track\xc2\xa0with some wonky trap synths dancing in the background, Semonte plays the boastful homewrecker; he flips his own name into an easy pun for a playful melody. If there\xe2\x80\x99s a lasting effect of this tape, and Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s recent success, it\xe2\x80\x99s that he\xe2\x80\x99s become an increasingly adept hook slinger\xe2\x80\x94prone to staying in pocket melodically, but versatile and daring in every other sense.' b'Not all the songs on Year in 2016\xc2\xa0originally belonged to the headliner, but when Trouble plays the featured artist, he\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic enough to make an impression. Still, a pair of Fetty Wap collaborations fall flat, not for lack of chemistry so much as a missed mark to begin with. And only one of Young Thug\xe2\x80\x99s three appearances marks\xc2\xa0a return to their banger\xe2\x80\x99s duet style. That track, the Goose-produced \xe2\x80\x9cRespect,\xe2\x80\x9d stands out early in the tape: Thug\xe2\x80\x99s no-filler second verse might be the attention grabber, but the song belongs to Trouble from the moment he lists his bonafides in the hook.' b'Year in 2016 rounds up the best of Trouble\xe2\x80\x99s best year yet, but it\xc2\xa0presses too much into a single compilation\xc2\xa0for a gratifying continuous listen. Still, an overloaded comp\xc2\xa0feels like a smart flex for Trouble, ample proof that he\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly, quietly launched an urgent second act. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been keeping up, Trouble is the type to remind you he\xe2\x80\x99s been here all along.'"
b'Richard Pinhas',7.2,b'Reverse',0,b'Experimental',b'January 24 2017',"b'This collaboration between experimental guitarist Richard Pinhas and Oren Ambarchi, Merzbow, and others\xc2\xa0sounds like rock music echoed out into the stratosphere.'","b'Save for a brief hiatus in the \xe2\x80\x9980s when he became disillusioned with music, guitarist Richard Pinhas has\xc2\xa0spent the last five decades making records, both solo and with many groups including \xe2\x80\x9970s French space-rock innovators Heldon. Lately he\xe2\x80\x99s been more productive, and collaborative, than ever: Reverse is his 14th release this decade, and like most of the others it features a fine supporting cast of accomplished players.' b'That cast began with Oren Ambarchi,\xc2\xa0a partner with Pinhas on their excellent 2014 album Tikkun. The pair recorded guitar drones in an initial session, stripped away the parts that they felt didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, and then added contributions from five collaborators including noise legend Merzbow, percussion master William Winant, and Pinhas\xe2\x80\x99s own son Duncan on synths. That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of large personalities to fit into one space, but *Reverse *never feels crowded or dominated. Its expansive mix of sounds comes off as democratic.' b'In fact, if there is such a thing as a star of Reverse, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of its lesser-known participants, drummer Arthur Narcy. On three of the four tracks in an album-length suite called \xe2\x80\x9cDronz,\xe2\x80\x9d Narcy\xe2\x80\x99s playing creates a sturdy spine for his colleagues to wrap tones around, while also being agile enough to respond to their amorphous improvisations. In some spots, as during the gradual climb of \xe2\x80\x9cDronz 2 - End,\xe2\x80\x9d he starts with a steady beat and tweaks it into abnormal shapes to match the guitars\xe2\x80\x99 thickening clouds. He takes the opposite tack on opener \xe2\x80\x9cDronz 1 - Ketter,\xe2\x80\x9d coagulating jazzy sounds\xc2\xa0until they become metronomic.' b'The textures that Pinhas and company surround Narcy with are in constant motion, and are dense enough that something new is revealed with each listen. The sound the\xc2\xa0group conjures is too spacey to be called noise and too busy to be called drone. Its base is\xc2\xa0rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll, though there\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0little in the way of riffs or single, discrete notes. *Reverse *sounds more like rock music echoed out into the stratosphere, extracting the essence of guitar chords the way the shining light of a star distills\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0core of something long gone.' b'Pinhas has called\xc2\xa0making *Reverse *a healing process, coming as it did during a stressful period\xc2\xa0in his personal life, including the passing of both of his parents. There\xc2\xa0is a therapeutic aspect to the way the music\xc2\xa0continually opens up the world, suggesting that looking forward can help alleviate the past. That\xe2\x80\x99s true even in the album\xe2\x80\x99s only drum-less track, \xe2\x80\x9cDronz 4 - V2,\xe2\x80\x9d whose whirring treble feels more like a cathartic scream than a medicinal potion. In the sure hands of Pinhas and his comrades, *Reverse *is big enough to contain emotional multitudes.'"

The singer is Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Tory Lanez, with hints of R&B cult fave Pleasure P from Pretty Ricky. Trey\xe2\x80\x99s guest opens up the mixtape on the slow, loopy jaunt \xe2\x80\x9cA3\xe2\x80\x9d promising \xe2\x80\x9cparty favors, party favors.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""With the assistance of his pupil, Trey Songz delivers on his usual dimpled-grin bedroom talk, but this time around he's consistently upstaged by other featured guests. New York\xe2\x80\x99s Justine Darcenne breathes new life into *Anticipation 3 *as the female antagonist of \xe2\x80\x9cFind My Love,\xe2\x80\x9d and the frank voice on the excellent \xe2\x80\x9cVibrator.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cVibrator\xe2\x80\x9d also includes a great turn by Chicago rapper Chisanity, whose sounds like a deeper-voiced 21 Savage crossed with\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAtlanta\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d fictional character Paper Boi. On the other hand, \xe2\x80\x9c93 Unleaded\xe2\x80\x9d could have worked without Dave East, whose\xc2\xa0bars and flow overwhelm the simplistic beat."" b'Like Trigga, Anticipation 3 dabbles with trap&b atmospherics, a la Bryson Tiller\xe2\x80\x99s TRAPSOUL. But Trey\xe2\x80\x99s voice is a little too powerful to blend into the background of the wispy production, and he is too much of an old-school star to disappear from the foreground for long.\xc2\xa0The best is saved for last: \xe2\x80\x9cSho Nuff,\xe2\x80\x9d a slow jam suited for the \xe2\x80\x9cQuiet Storm\xe2\x80\x9d segments of late-night urban radio. \xc2\xa0The electric guitar chords and eager hook of \xe2\x80\x9cis you still my baby, she say sho\xe2\x80\x99 you right\xe2\x80\x9d is Trey at his freshest, throwing all the way back to the vibe of\xc2\xa0his 2005 debut I Gotta Make It.' b'Surprisingly enough, the other show stealer comes from Mike x Angel on closing bonus track, \xe2\x80\x9cAnxious.\xe2\x80\x9d Trey Songz is nowhere to be found as Angel tenderly asks a lover \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we doing? What should I call this?\xe2\x80\x9d. Instead, we\xe2\x80\x99re held to anticipate new music from an up and coming talent, wondering if this could be a sign of an Aaron Hall being usurped by his Kellz. Only time will tell, but based on recent events, it seems highly unlikely Trigga would allow that to become a reality.'"
b'Kreator',6.2,b'Gods of Violence',0,b'Metal',b'January 23 2017',"b""On their fourteenth studio album, thrash legends Kreator give us more of the same jackhammer style they built the band's name on\xe2\x80\x94only without quite as much personality or edge.""","b""Kreator\xe2\x80\x99s 1985 debut Endless Pain arrived two years after Metallica fired thrash metal's first shot with *Kill 'Em All\xe2\x80\x94*something of an eternity in the formative stages of a genre. Kreator immediately stood out, though, with their static-y guitars, frontman/guitarist Mille Petrozza's inimitable bark, and drummer J\xc3\xbcrgen \xe2\x80\x9cVentor\xe2\x80\x9d Reil\xe2\x80\x99s distinct combination of precision and primal savagery. So it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the German thrash outfit to gain ground on their elite predecessors with landmark albums like 1989\xe2\x80\x99s Extreme Aggression, 1990\xe2\x80\x99s Coma of Souls, and 1992\xe2\x80\x99s Renewal."" b'Of course, if you measure the energy level of those titles next to their new album Gods of Violence, there\xe2\x80\x99s just no comparison. By the same token, it would be too easy to dismiss the band\xe2\x80\x99s latter-day work as just an excuse to tour. After a run of four experimental, industrial-tinged albums in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, Kreator re-dedicated themselves to straight thrash on 2001\xe2\x80\x99s *Violent Revolution\xe2\x80\x94a\xc2\xa0*move that might have signified a\xc2\xa0surrender to heritage-act status if the band hadn\xe2\x80\x99t sounded so revitalized at the time.' b'Some of that vitality was on display as recently as last year\xe2\x80\x99s Violence Unleashed EP, but Gods of Violence suggests that it might be time for another shake-up. The band\xe2\x80\x99s fourteenth full-length, Gods of Violence does contain some noteworthy deviations from form. Album opener \xe2\x80\x9cApocalypticon,\xe2\x80\x9d an orchestral piece courtesy of Fleshgod Apocalypse members Francesco Paoli and Francesco Ferrini, bears more than a passing resemblance to both the Star Wars theme and the \xe2\x80\x9cMars\xe2\x80\x9d movement of Holst\xe2\x80\x99s iconic suite The Planets.' b'Bagpipes appear on the Celtic-flavored \xe2\x80\x9cHail to the Hordes,\xe2\x80\x9d while the title track intro features a solo from a 12 year-old harpist. And, for better or worse, the bright melody in the chorus section of \xe2\x80\x9cTotalitarian Terror\xe2\x80\x9d wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sound out of place in the hands of pop-punk acts like Against Me! or Anti-Flag. Mostly, though, Petrozza and Reil give us more of the same jackhammer style they built the band\xe2\x80\x99s name on\xe2\x80\x94only without quite as much personality or edge. Case in point: the verse riff on \xe2\x80\x9cTotalitarian Terror,\xe2\x80\x9d which sees Petrozza coming dangerously close to re-treading Slayer when Slayer have been most guilty of re-treading themselves.' b""At times, Gods of Violence plays like an unresolved tug of war between quintessential Kreator and grandiose symphonic metal\xe2\x80\x94often in the same song. If you like both styles, you can expect to be in hog heaven. But if you prefer one over the other, you're left to skip over certain sections of songs. \xe2\x80\x9cArmy of Storms,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, hearkens back to signature riffs from the back-catalog staples \xe2\x80\x9cBetrayer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRenewal\xe2\x80\x9d in the verse but then abruptly switches to an operatic chorus. In general, when Gods of Violence hews towards outsized melody, it feels watered-down rather than stretched out."" b'Lyrically, Gods of Violence suffers in a similar way. Perhaps more than any other genre, part of the job requirement of being a heavy metal musician is the ability to come up with song titles and lyrics that look badass scrawled across the pages of high schoolers\xe2\x80\x99 notebooks. If we ranked bands based on that criterion, Kreator would surely land near the top of the list. For the last 30-plus years, Petrozza has penned gem after lyrical gem, amassing a string of fist-waving catchphrases that rival anyone in metal. So it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that Petrozza doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint on Gods of Violence.' b""Petrozza has a way of distilling a song\xe2\x80\x99s chorus down to a punchline he delivers in single syllables, as if he wanted to ensure that even a child or non-English speaker could imagine a bouncing dot in their heads as they follow along. You have to be willing to indulge a little boneheadedness to get behind classic back-catalog nuggets like \xe2\x80\x9cTime/to/raise/your/flag/of/hate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cUn-/der/the/gui-/llo-/tine.\xe2\x80\x9d But a trademark Kreator chorus makes it irresistible to sing along. You haven't lived, for example, until you\xe2\x80\x99ve sung the titular chorus of the new song \xe2\x80\x9cSatan Is Real\xe2\x80\x9d at an inappropriate volume in a setting where you\xe2\x80\x99re bound to raise eyebrows.(Attention ad execs: this is the song you need for your seitan ad!)"" b'That said, despite Petrozza\xe2\x80\x99s gift for communicating directly to the angsty teenager at the core of every metalhead\xe2\x80\x99s soul, his subject matter speaks to a thoughtful way of observing the world. Petrozza also has a knack for using his words to convey the opposite of what they seem to indicate on first (or even second) glance. The new material exemplifies this technique: For Petrozza, Satan is a fictitious concept that becomes \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d because people invest it with belief. \xe2\x80\x9cDeath Becomes My Light,\xe2\x80\x9d meanwhile, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t glamorize death in stereotypically \xe2\x80\x9cmetal\xe2\x80\x9d fashion but instead looks at dying through the lens of a near-death experience. And the title track, with its chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall kill,\xe2\x80\x9d is actually a life-affirming call to evolve past (and thus \xe2\x80\x9ckill\xe2\x80\x9d) antiquated modes of thinking that no longer serve humanity\xe2\x80\x99s forward progress.' b'Petrozza even delves into utopian reverie with \xe2\x80\x9cHail to the Hordes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94basically a heavy metal buddy anthem that offers solace and solidarity as \xe2\x80\x9cthe failed, the outcasts... carry each other through the darkest moments in life.\xe2\x80\x9d But this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a Kreator album if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to dark places. Originally conceived as a concept album rooted in Greek mythology, Gods of Violence frames modern warfare as a remnant of an ancient evil that has resided in the psyche for as long as our species has existed. Petrozza\xe2\x80\x99s original idea was to present our predilection for viciousness as something that was \xe2\x80\x9cborn\xe2\x80\x9d into our world after the gods decided to have an orgy.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a rich premise\xe2\x80\x94unfortunately, Petrozza doesn\xe2\x80\x99t flesh it out very much in the actual songs. G**ods of Violence could have used more of Petrozza\xe2\x80\x99s warped take. He\xc2\xa0has renounced the audacious moves the band made during its experimental period, but at least those moves were charged with a sense of creative risk. After several albums\xe2\x80\x99 worth of proving they can still recapture their classic sound, it\xe2\x80\x99s high time Kreator took more risks, come what may. They\xe2\x80\x99ve earned the right.'"

All three members were in the important and longstanding R&B vocal group New Edition, but none were ever a central focus of the ensemble. They were consistently overshadowed by Ralph Tresvant, who provided lead vocals on most New Edition tracks; Johnny Gill, who joined the group in 1988 for their most fully realized album, Heart Break, but already had hits of his own; and even by former member Bobby Brown, who left New Edition in 1985 and hit No. 1 on the Hot 100 three years later. While Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie Devoe were essential to the success of the group as a whole, they almost always served to support their more prominent co-stars.' b""Until they didn't: heeding advice from the world-class production duo Jam & Lewis, Bell Biv Devoe formed a trio and released an album that was eventually certified quadruple platinum. Of the New Edition diaspora, Brown enjoyed the most sales and notoriety, Tresvant approached one-note perfection with \xe2\x80\x9cSensitivity,\xe2\x80\x9d and Gill built an enviable collection of ballads, but it was the underdogs in Bell Biv Devoe who came up with that elusive thing, a crossover standard which everyone will know for eternity: \xe2\x80\x9cPoison.\xe2\x80\x9d President Obama recently invited the group to the White House to perform the track, confirming its designation as a piece of universal American pop culture."" b""That honor makes it a fine time for Bell Biv Devoe to reemerge with Three Stripes. They're also likely to benefit from New Edition\xe2\x80\x99s high level of visibility at the moment: the group returned to the radio for the first time in over a decade last year, credited as featured vocalists on Johnny Gill\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 R&B hit \xe2\x80\x9cThis One\xe2\x80\x99s For Me And You,\xe2\x80\x9d and a three-part New Edition biopic is slated to air on BET the same week that Three Stripes hits the shelves."" b""This is the first Bell Biv Devoe album in 16 years, and early on, it feels like the trio is stepping gingerly, with continuity in mind above all else. Despite their time away from the studio, Bivins and Devoe still rap in the end-rhyme-heavy style of the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. And since the majority of the group's early hits were smutty accounts of the group's interactions with the opposite sex, similar narratives guide several songs on Three Stripes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll say a bunch of slick shit to get between your thighs,\xe2\x80\x9d Devoe promises in \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Betta,\xe2\x80\x9d a pushy, hurry-up-and-leave-him-number which reminds listeners that 49 year-olds have the right to be juvenile, too."" b""But despite these allusions, Three Stripes rarely crackles in the manner of early Bell Biv Devoe\xe2\x80\x94the Poison album is resiliently pesky, like an especially pugnacious welterweight, but there's little of that scrappy spirit here. As they did in 1990, the trio calls on hip-hop producers for help: Erick Sermon of the famous New York hip-hop duo EPMD crafted \xe2\x80\x9cRun,\xe2\x80\x9d and other beat makers here include DJ Battlecat (Snoop Dogg, Xzibit) and Doug E. Fresh. But the tracks are mostly either pedestrian and unmemorable, or memorable for the wrong reasons. This is exemplified by the lead single, \xe2\x80\x9cRun,\xe2\x80\x9d which redundantly interpolates Notorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHypnotize,\xe2\x80\x9d a song too molded to Biggie to provide a favorable look for anyone else."" b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a pair of the least energetic moments, though, which turn out to be the richest on the record. While Bell Biv Devoe classics mostly eschewed harmony, a New Edition hallmark, in favor of skeletal thwack, the trio embraces the full-group approach on the back half of Three Stripes. When Bell trades verses with SWV\xe2\x80\x99s scene-stealing Coko on the ballad \xe2\x80\x9cFinally,\xe2\x80\x9d her full, trembling tone nourishes his lancing falsetto. And Boyz II Men, who owe their name to a New Edition song, appear on \xe2\x80\x9cOne More Try,\xe2\x80\x9d helping create a benign, slender number based around Jerry Butler\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Could Write A Book\xe2\x80\x9d from 1970.' b""Plummy as these tracks are, they make you wonder why Bell Biv Devoe didn\xe2\x80\x99t recruit from the crack platoon of contemporary songwriters most adept at balancing R&B tradition with the requirements of today's production practices.

b'PnB Rock',6.6,b'GTTM: Goin Thru the Motions',0,b'Rap',b'January 23 2017',b'Philly artist PnB broke out last year with an appealing rapper-turned-singer swagger. His major label debut carefully balances his malleable take\xc2\xa0on R&B and street rap.',"b'Philadelphia rap is undergoing a generational shift. Despite all the tabloid drama, Meek Mill remains the city\xe2\x80\x99s biggest star, rapping with the emotional intensity of hometown legend Beanie Sigel, but with a honed ability to land crossover hits. Yet the city\xe2\x80\x99s two up-and-coming stars operate completely outside the street-vs.-pop divide that Meek observes so carefully.\xc2\xa0Lil Uzi Vert is a bratty rockstar that cannot write a bad hook and and PnB Rock wields a rapper-turned-singer swagger. Meek Mill rapped on Philly street corners and committed years to the mixtape grind, where this new wave was scooped up early by major labels, landing on success that took years for Meek to achieve.' b'PnB Rock went from catching regional buzz with\xc2\xa0post-prison freestyles in 2014 to signing with Atlantic Records the following year. In that short time, Fetty Wap, another rapper-turned-singer from the Tri-State area, emerged and crossed over with numerous Top 40 pop hits (\xe2\x80\x9cTrap Queen,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c679\xe2\x80\x9d). Last year they released a joint mixtape, Money, Hoes, and Flows that highlighted Fetty Wap\xe2\x80\x99s charming vocal quirks set against\xc2\xa0PnB Rock\xe2\x80\x99s more conventional singing voice.' b'*GTTM: Going Through The Motions, *PnB Rock\xe2\x80\x99s major-label debut, carefully balances his malleable interpretations of both R&B and street rap. \xe2\x80\x9cRange Rover\xe2\x80\x9d fits a boastful trap mold (\xe2\x80\x9cRollie all on my wrist/Bitch I ball no assist/Smoking weed by the zip/Whole squad yeah we lit\xe2\x80\x9d), but his smooth delivery pushes the song closer to acoustic Ty Dolla $ign than Migos. On the other side of the spectrum is \xe2\x80\x9cNotice Me,\xe2\x80\x9d where Rock pines for a second of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s time, whose attention is buried in social media. The sentiment can feel like Drake-style shaming, but his words are empathetic when he wistfully sings: \xe2\x80\x9cIn your hand all day, on the \xe2\x80\x99gram all day/You been tweeting, snapchatting/And I feel like I just got to ask you/Do you notice me?\xe2\x80\x9d PnB Rock\xe2\x80\x99s delivery convey a simple a desire to find a romantic middle ground more than chauvinistic condemnation.' b'Song-by-song, *GTTM is a charming debut, but when viewed as complete album it falls fairly flat. It opens on a sour note with the Wiz Khalifa-featuring \xe2\x80\x9cAttention.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet instead of the suave Kush and OJ\xc2\xa0*Wiz, we get the\xc2\xa0boastful *Cabin Fever *version, full of to turgid go-nowhere cliches (\xe2\x80\x9cWhole lotta weed getting rolled in a paper plane/Whole lotta bitches scream my name\xe2\x80\x9d). Either of the following tracks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThere She Go,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPlaya No More,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSelfish\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94would have been\xc2\xa0stronger introductions, potential hits that also offer clear introductions to PnB Rock\xe2\x80\x99s worldview.' b""Unfortunately, tracklisting issues dog the album to its closing seconds. \xe2\x80\x9cNew Day,\xe2\x80\x9d produced by frequent Lil Uzi Vert collaborator Maaly Raw, is buried as the penultimate track, where it could\xe2\x80\x99ve added a bit of energy to the album\xe2\x80\x99s tepid middle section. The album closes with \xe2\x80\x9cStand Back,\xe2\x80\x9d an aggressive, calculated classic piece of East Coast street rap featuring Bronx up-and-comer A-Boogie Wit Da Hoodie. The pair share a natural chemistry, but there are no sparks here as the two jockey to see who can act the hardest. Fans in a post-iTunes streaming world can easily cull the best songs, \xc2\xa0but it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate the album places that burden on them. Still,PnB Rock shows more than enough heart and talent; pick through the missteps, and there's still a good new artist here, someone capable of more."""
b'Phil Ochs',8.5,b'I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore',0,b'Folk/Country',b'January 22 2017',"b'Phil Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 second album is a work of long-steeped fury at his country\xe2\x80\x99s sins, naked in its scorn for a system showing its many fissures; still, it guards a flickering, tenacious hope.'","b'Though the cover shot of I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore is a graveyard of grim political rhetoric\xe2\x80\x94Phil Ochs slumped against a wall of torn Barry Goldwater and Kenneth Keating posters, their slogans shredded and inscrutable\xe2\x80\x94the back cover essays comprise\xc2\xa0a beatnik rhapsody for the ages. Written by Ochs and the critic Bruce Jackson, they deliver the sort of earnest, overly verbose salvo\xc2\xa0only a Greenwich Village protest-folk record could deliver: a dense scrum of cheers to the Movement, jeers at the invertebrates in Congress, and navel-gazings on the quest for truth in art, with a track listing and credits seemingly wedged in as afterthought.' b'Midway through all the eager pulpit-pounding, though, the 24-year-old Ochs takes a turn both petulant and self-effacing, listing the most frequent complains that have been lobbed at him in his short career:' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing as dull as yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s headlines.' b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so ambitious.' b'Sure it\xe2\x80\x99s good, but who\xe2\x80\x99s gonna care next year?' b'I bet you don\xe2\x80\x99t go to church.' b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so negative.' b'I came to be entertained, not preached to.' b'That\xe2\x80\x99s nice but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really go far enough.' b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not folk music.' b'Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you move to Russia?' b'Which is what you got in 1965 for leaping up onto a bench in Washington Square Park and warbling your dismay at the morning\xe2\x80\x99s New York Times: you were branded an ally of the communist kleptocracy, back when that sort of charge might actually end your career. (Simpler times.) But Ochs didn\xe2\x80\x99t argue these accusations; he reveled in them as proof of concept, his confirmation that he was hitting the establishment where it hurt. He labeled himself a \xe2\x80\x9csinging journalist,\xe2\x80\x9d not a folk singer like the rest of his Bleecker Street fraternity (Bob Dylan, Dave Van Ronk__,__ Tom Paxton), and stuffed his lyrics with the up-to-the-minute topicality and op-ed lambasting of a newsman\xe2\x80\x94championing a coal miners\xe2\x80\x99 strike in Kentucky one verse__,__ decrying Marines landing at Santo Domingo the next. He called the front pages like a guerrilla newsie, merging the sardonic wit of Woody Guthrie, the chatty candor of Pete Seeger, and the lone-gunslinger bravado of Hank Williams.' b'And in the troubled arc of Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 career\xe2\x80\x94in which he began as the voice of the antiwar movement and heir apparent to Dylan, then cooled into his also-ran, then sank a bitter and penniless outcast\xe2\x80\x94these cries of unpatriotism were a rare constant. He died not even knowing their extent; decades after he committed suicide in 1976, at age 35, the Freedom of Information Act unearthed a FBI monitoring dossier on him, thick as a novel.' b'But only a true American idealist could have written I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore. Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 second album is a work of long-steeped fury at his country\xe2\x80\x99s sins, naked in its scorn for a system showing its many fissures; still, it guards a flickering, tenacious hope that the nation can reach its potential to embrace, to empathize. It is a work of nationalistic heartbreak, the deploring of a terrible fate: the requiem of a romantic with nowhere to love. It is zealously leftist, so unequivocal as to smack of propaganda over poetry, almost wholly dependent on Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 inculcating wordplay: with his twangy, octave-at-best vocal range, stevedore coffee shop strumming, and modest melodies, this album grabs your throat entirely on lyrical ferocity.' b'But to Ochs, there was no time for subtlety. The Lyndon B. Johnson administration was escalating involvement in Vietnam, ignoring countrywide demonstrations of dissent and returning body bags by the thousands; the racial friction of the South was exploding in bombings and riots; young Americans were still rudderless from the assassination of President Kennedy, mourning that era of profound hope and their purpose within it. Ochs absorbed it all and was a true believer in tuneful social reform; as he quipped in the program notes of the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to see an album called Elvis Presley Sings Songs of the Spanish Civil War or The Beatles with the Best of the Chinese Border Dispute Songs.\xe2\x80\x9d But until the day that happened, Ochs was here for us, offering 14 brisk tracks of fingerpicked guitar and unvarnished tenor, distilling the world\xe2\x80\x99s chaos into a frightening thesis: An era of optimism and social promise was not only ending, but taking alarming leaps backward. But, he stressed, there was still time to reverse course.' b""He sets his agenda firmly in the title track\xe2\x80\x94an opener that rouses and incites despite a pallor of exhaustion, regret, and fear. Over a simple acoustic strum with a subtly agitated back-trill, Ochs travels the bloody scope of American warfare, gazing wearily through the eyes of a soldier whose obedience has cost him his humanity. He begins at the War of 1812, where \xe2\x80\x9cthe young land started growing/The young blood started flowing\xe2\x80\x9d; then he grips a glinting bayonet in the Civil War, pilots a plane through Japanese skies that sets off \xe2\x80\x9cthe mighty mushroom roar.\xe2\x80\x9d When Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 warrior reaches the \xe2\x80\x9cCuban shore,\xe2\x80\x9d and sees the missiles looming overhead, he grinds down his heels at last. \xe2\x80\x9cIt's always the old to lead us to the wars/Always the young to fall,\xe2\x80\x9d he laments__.__ \xe2\x80\x9cNow look at all we've won/With a saber and a gun/Tell me is it worth it all?\xe2\x80\x9d In a few breaths, Ochs not only decries the cyclical carnage of war, he explores the individual in bloodshed with clear-eyed empathy and lays a wrenching argument for ethical subversion. \xe2\x80\x9cCall it peace, or call it treason/Call it love, or call it reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he quavers, \xe2\x80\x9cBut I ain't marching anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d Here, his oft-nasal voice betrays a slight Scottish lilt, the result of his Queens-based family\xe2\x80\x99s brief stint in Edinburgh when he was a child\xe2\x80\x94a warm, global topnote to his treaty. Upon its release, \xe2\x80\x9cI Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore\xe2\x80\x9d became a ubiquitous anthem of the antiwar movement, and Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 signature tune; when he performed it outside the Democratic National Convention in 1968, hundreds of young men burned their draft cards."" b""Ochs may have dropped out of journalism school (at Ohio State, where his fervent political columns got him demoted from the school paper), but he retained a penchant for interviewing strangers whenever he performed, from uptown street corners to dirt roads in the deep South. Early into Side A, on \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Heat of the Summer,\xe2\x80\x9d Ochs recalls scenes from the Harlem riot of 1964, his reporter\xe2\x80\x99s eye for detail gleaming in the \xe2\x80\x9cloudspeaker drowned like a whisperin' sound\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cuniforms shoving with their sticks/Asking, \xe2\x80\x98Are you looking for trouble?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d While touring the summer folk festival circuit, he passed through Mississippi shortly after the abductions and murders of three civil rights workers\xe2\x80\x94James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner\xe2\x80\x94as they registered African Americans to vote. Ochs marched up to their neighbors, pen and paper in hand; their unease and obstinance informs \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s to the State of Mississippi,\xe2\x80\x9d a scorched-earth screed that implicates rural communities for resisting social progress and denounces the lack of education and options that perpetuate the spiral of intolerance."" b'\xe2\x80\x9cTalking Birmingham Jam\xe2\x80\x9d is a brutal lament of the violence in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963, when black residents demonstrated in opposition of the city\xe2\x80\x99s Jim Crow racial segregation laws__.__ In response, President Kennedy sent the National Guard to enforce integration in its schools, catalyzing the Civil Rights Act\xe2\x80\x94and the city\xe2\x80\x99s public safety commissioner, Eugene \xe2\x80\x9cBull\xe2\x80\x9d Connor, replied with attack dogs, high-pressure water hoses, and club-wielding cops. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, all the signs said \xe2\x80\x98Welcome In\xe2\x80\x99/Signed by Governor Wallace and Rin Tin Tin/They said come along and watch the fights/While we feed our dogs on civil rights,\xe2\x80\x9d Ochs seethes in a conversational sing-song lifted from Guthrie, excoriating Connor and George Wallace. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see Alabama is a sovereign state/With sovereign dogs and sovereign hate.\xe2\x80\x9d His words echo powerful ones Martin Luther King, Jr. penned the year before, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not known how deliberately. \xe2\x80\x9cThe silent password was fear. It was a fear not only on the part of the black oppressed, but also in the hearts of the white oppressors,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. King wrote of Birmingham in Why We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was also the dread of change, that all too prevalent fear which hounds those whose attitudes have been hardened by the long winter of reaction.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'While I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore arrived at a fractious moment in American history, it also landed at a strong pivot for Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 beloved Greenwich Village protest-folk microcosm: it was the beginning of the end for this bohemian idyll. Ochs had moved to New York three years earlier, where the same liberal ire that made him an outcast in Ohio ingratiated him instantly with the other young troubadours at the Bitter End and the Gaslight. He played peace rallies at Carnegie Hall with Dylan and palling around with Van Ronk and Paxton afterward at dimly lit poker tables, sprawling in shoddy apartments to tease out new songs. He crashed on the couch of Jim Glover, his college roommate, with whom he\xe2\x80\x99d once formed a band called the Singing Socialists; Glover was now half of the sweetheart folk duo Jim and Jean. (If they sound familiar, their name and saccharine charisma\xe2\x80\x94plus Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 frequent irascibility toward them\xe2\x80\x94were imported wholesale into Inside Llewyn Davis.)' b""Dylan and Ochs were the heaviest hitters in the New York scene, and their reputations preceded them; in this time, they were described by *Melody Maker *in England as the \xe2\x80\x9cking of protest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe president,\xe2\x80\x9d respectively. They shared a mostly cordial rivalry, one with the hierarchy firmly apparent. As the Ochs biography Death of a Rebel details, Ochs revered Dylan openly, but Dylan was mercurial in return; he once raved of Ochs, \xe2\x80\x9cI just can't keep up with Phil. And he's getting better and better and better,\xe2\x80\x9d but was also quick to call him a \xe2\x80\x9cturncoat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copportunist\xe2\x80\x9d for wanting fame as nakedly as he did. (Once, Dylan allegedly kicked Ochs out of a limousine, hurling the \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re just a singing journalist\xe2\x80\x9d epithet back in his face as the final indignity.) But for several years, both musicians coexisted in the same topical nexus. They both flourished at the landmark 1963 Newport Folk Festival; Pete Seeger, upon hearing them perform at a counterculture newspaper office, predicted vast fame for both. In one of many overlapping lyrical examples, they both bemoaned the death of civil rights activist Medgar Evers in 1964: Dylan on \xe2\x80\x9cOnly A Pawn in Their Game\xe2\x80\x9d (from The Times They Are a-Changin\xe2\x80\x99), Ochs on \xe2\x80\x9cToo Many Martyrs\xe2\x80\x9d (from his debut, All the News That\xe2\x80\x99s Fit to Sing). And both were well-known volatiles; Dylan was the imperious prodigy simultaneously enjoying and bemoaning society\xe2\x80\x99s quick deification of him. Ochs, one year older, envied his recognition openly and had a likewise-sticky reputation as a hothead alcoholic, a handsome narcissist who\xe2\x80\x99d beaten girlfriends and alienated friends."" b'By 1965, Greenwich Village folk had begun splintering into their separate schools of folk ideology: Ochs believed folk songwriting should affect reactionary change in politics via blunt broadcasting of information and resistance, while Dylan teased out philosophical truths through personal ruminations, and daubing that canvas with larger social metaphor. That year, as Ochs continued to file his topical acoustic briefs sourced from *Newsweek *and The Village Voice, Dylan fully sniffed at it, \xe2\x80\x9cgoing electric\xe2\x80\x9d at the Newport Folk Festival and releasing Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. (Consider the former\xe2\x80\x99s oblique Side A protest, \xe2\x80\x9cMaggie\xe2\x80\x99s Farm,\xe2\x80\x9d a rollicking yet not-so-dissimilar bray of sedition as \xe2\x80\x9cI Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94though, in this case, Dylan was protesting against protest folk.) Commercial favor tipped to Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s rock rancor; it would not bend back toward Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 bleeding headlines. As Christopher Hitchens summarized in the Ochs documentary There But for Fortune, \xe2\x80\x9cPhil\xe2\x80\x99s very tough, grainy songs\xe2\x80\xa6were far more political and tough-minded than the much more generalized, accessible \xe2\x80\x98Blowin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Wind.\xe2\x80\x99 There was a difference between people who liked Bob Dylan\xe2\x80\x94anyone could like Bob Dylan, everybody did\xe2\x80\x94and those who even knew about Phil Ochs.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""But serious-minded as Ochs was, he was not without his gallows humor\xe2\x80\x94the secret weapon of I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore. \xe2\x80\x9cDraft Dodger Rag\xe2\x80\x9d is a droll riff on shirking the call to Vietnam, spry with the impishness of a boy claiming fang marks on his homework. Ochs spits out any and every excuse that will get him discharged from duty: \xe2\x80\x9cI've got a dislocated disc and a wracked-up back/I'm allergic to flowers and bugs,\xe2\x80\x9d he wheedles. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd when the bombshell hits, I get epileptic fits/And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs.\xe2\x80\x9d Not all his cop-outs have aged well, exactly, by progressive standards (\xe2\x80\x9cI always carry a purse\xe2\x80\x9d sets off a modern air-raid siren), but it\xe2\x80\x99s an endearing novelty. And as with all Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 songs, there is a galvanizing point staked into the sand: the draft fell disproportionately to the poor, the uneducated, and minorities. Another lighter offering, comparatively, is \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s What I Want to Hear,\xe2\x80\x9d a call to arms for the exploited and whiny (inert liberals being a favored punching bag of Ochs\xe2\x80\x99). \xe2\x80\x9cYou tell me that your last good dollar is gone/And you say that your pockets are bare,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings at a sharp but not-unkind clip. Soon enough, \xe2\x80\x9cNow don't tell me your troubles/No, I don't have the time to spare/But if you want to get together and fight/Good buddy, that's what I want to hear.\xe2\x80\x9d It is a call to action but, notably, not to knee-jerk jingoism; mobilization is easy in the first flush of fear but resistance, if taken to conclusion, will always be a pyrrhic victory. Here, Ochs tapers one of his core, conclusively patriotic theses: that he, and his listeners, should be willing to lose some comforts to keep the world turning."" b""The most affecting moment of the album is \xe2\x80\x9cThat Was the President,\xe2\x80\x9d Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 eulogy to President Kennedy that speaks to the shattered disillusionment of his generation. It\xe2\x80\x99s sung as softly as an echo across wooden pews. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a memory to share, here's a memory to save/Of the sudden early ending of command,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighs. \xe2\x80\x9cYet a part of you and a part of me is buried in his grave/That was the President and that was the man.\xe2\x80\x9d It aches with lack of resolution; it\xe2\x80\x99s a memorial to the idealism the president fostered, whose administration itself shuttered in unfulfilled promise of its progressive agenda. (There is more than a wisp of the paternal here; Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 father also died in 1963.)"" b'Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 music after I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore would be pocked by outside influences; he jealously watched less overtly political colleagues like Dylan and Peter, Paul and Mary reach national fame, and struggled to reconcile his ardency for social reform with his craving to be a star. He watched artists advance on his back; Joan Baez\xe2\x80\x99s cover of his compassionate tune \xe2\x80\x9cThere But for Fortune\xe2\x80\x9d charted in the Top 50 in both America and the UK, higher than he\xe2\x80\x99d ever managed. Frustrated, he retreated from earnest topicality; his next full studio album, Pleasures of the Harbor, folded in lush, Sinatra-strings and ragtime piano, adding a poppier bend to his dour character studies of empty socialites and downtrodden flower vendors. He became disillusioned with demonstrating; he and his Yippie party cohorts staged a protest at 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, during which they nominated an actual pig for president (name: Pigasus), but the mirth ended in a massive, era-defining riot between protesters and police. He retreated from New York, his wife, and his daughter, drinking heavily, heaped his flagging idealism on the communist uprisings of Fidel Castro and the Marxist Chilean revolutionary Salvador Allende. His erratic creative path onward included self-funded, unsuccessful tours through South America and Africa (where he was arrested for performing at a political rally in Uruguay, robbed and strangled in Tanzania), and attempting to replicate Elvis Presley\xe2\x80\x99s 1969 comeback show in Las Vegas with his own mystifying performance in gold lam\xc3\xa9 at Carnegie Hall. He dabbled more in symphonic pop and recruited Van Dyke Parks for a country-western turn (sarcastically called Phil Ochs\xe2\x80\x99 Greatest Hits), all of which fell flat commercially.' b'Abetted by his rampant alcoholism and persistent writer\xe2\x80\x99s block, Ochs slid into a bipolar breakdown; not even the end of the Vietnam War, and its ensuing celebratory concerts, could rouse him from his nosedive. He adopted an alternate identity called \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Train\xe2\x80\x9d and went on paranoid rants onstage, insisting he had murdered Phil Ochs and the CIA was after him. (The miserable irony of the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s monitoring.) He slept on the streets, got arrested, attacked friends. On April 9, 1976, amid the gaudy patriotism of the Bicentennial Celebration, he hanged himself at his sister\xe2\x80\x99s home in Queens.' b'But for a moment, Phil Ochs existed in pure conviction. I Ain\xe2\x80\x99t Marching Anymore reminds us to resist the dangers of acquiescence, to take to the streets to demand the country that still persists in our hearts, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not before to our eyes anymore. It would be easy to stop marching in apathy or in defeat, but Ochs pushed for something greater: a righteous, excruciating, beautiful reclamation. Small wonder his powerful polemics have been covered and updated by the Clash, Neil Young, Jello Biafra: His fight was never just his, never just of his time. And in the right hands, it will never die.'"

Art might not, as the myth goes, get better during bleak times, but bleak times do make people cling harder to the art they\xe2\x80\x99ve got.' b'Electronic artist Katie Stelmanis has always made political art, blatantly or subtly, from her time with riot grrl band Galaxy to her more muted project, Austra. But since 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Olympia, politics have gotten more, well, urgent. Stelmanis is Canadian and wrote *Future Politics *before the election results and before fascism started winning, but the album\xe2\x80\x99s Inauguration Day release is now looming, inescapable subtext. \xe2\x80\x9cI was kind of worried it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be something that people would be interested in, or connect to... [but it\xe2\x80\x99s] become more relevant than I could\xe2\x80\x99ve ever imagined,\xe2\x80\x9d she told CBC.' b'Future Politics doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depart from Austra\xe2\x80\x99s sound so much as filter it. Stelmanis\xe2\x80\x99 band, and its sound, are pared down, producing straightforward, minimal music akin to club artists like\xc2\xa0Marie Davidson or Kate Wax, or perhaps Bj\xc3\xb6rk\xe2\x80\x99s electronic work. Even Stelmanis\xe2\x80\x99 voice, capable of great force, sounds less operatic than deliberately hollowed-out, as in the tentative melodies of \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond a\xc2\xa0Mortal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGaia\xe2\x80\x9d or the collapsing coloratura of \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Monster.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""Austra fills the extra space by surfacing the themes formerly held in the band\xe2\x80\x99s subtext, though\xc2\xa0occasionally stated, like *Olympia\xe2\x80\x99*s \xe2\x80\x9cI Don't Care (I\xe2\x80\x99m a Man).\xe2\x80\x9d While writing this album, Stelmanis was into science fiction and political manifestos\xe2\x80\x94in particular, the Accelerationist Manifesto and Marge Piercy\xe2\x80\x99s canonical Woman on the Edge of Time, a novel whose utopian visions reach its main character amid abuse and institutional detention. \xe2\x80\x9cIt needed to have a purpose other than just my own ego,\xe2\x80\x9d Stelmanis said. And while Future Politics isn\xe2\x80\x99t impersonal\xe2\x80\x94throughout it\xc2\xa0runs an undercurrent of loss, partly the result of personal and professional departures in Stelmanis\xe2\x80\x99 life\xe2\x80\x94the album concerns itself primarily with the dark side of \xe2\x80\x9cthe personal is political,\xe2\x80\x9d the slow parallel rot of self-contained\xc2\xa0depression and political turmoil. When the definition of disordered thinking resembles, so closely and measurably, a world increasingly disordered and unmoored from fact, what do you even do? How do you think? How do you begin to conceive a way out?"" b'It\xe2\x80\x99s fitting that the first track of the album is a question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if we were alive?\xe2\x80\x9d Stelmanis sings over synth pads and unsettled chords, like closing credits for a bittersweet ending. \xe2\x80\x9cFreepower,\xe2\x80\x9d like its near-namesake, presents a twitchy, unsettled mix and a plea for the personal. The title track is a driving sequencer track shaped like an anthem, but gets only as far as a battle cry: \xe2\x80\x9cfuture politics.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s still mourning in the present to get past, after all, and the midsection of the album dwells upon it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Monster\xe2\x80\x9d begins like the bridge of a club track, the sort with tears-on-the-dancefloor and throbbing backing vocals, but where that track would provide release, there\xe2\x80\x99s only hollowness: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel nothing anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGaia\xe2\x80\x9d dwells upon loss as well; the track most reminiscent of Bj\xc3\xb6rk, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a cut from a less optimistic *Biophilia**, *where the environment\xe2\x80\x99s full of more death than life.' b'Despite all this, *Future Politics *is essentially an optimistic album, and presents solutions. First: self-care is important. \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Thought,\xe2\x80\x9d a minute-long, a cappella harp palpitation at the end of the record, is reminiscent of dream pop or chillout, or even ASMR\xe2\x80\x94soothing genres. Second: make connections. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for me to write in a major key,\xe2\x80\x9d Stelmanis said (partly in jest) while touring Olympia, but \xe2\x80\x9cI Love You More Than You Love Yourself\xe2\x80\x9d accomplishes this musically and metaphorically, taking an idea last seen in dull dance backfill and turning it into an ode to redemptive love. \xe2\x80\x9cUtopia\xe2\x80\x9d has the album\xe2\x80\x99s lushest arrangement, a whirlwind of chiming trance synths, cheery octaves and airy background vocals, and its most indomitably romantic lyric: \xe2\x80\x9cI only want to hold your hand my own damn life/I can picture a place where everyone feels it too.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s got the highest notes and most triumphant melodies of the album. It\xe2\x80\x99s music to be escaped into, whether on dance floors or alone somewhere, filled with a little less despair.'"
b'Stefflon Don',6.0,b'Real Ting',0,b'Rap',b'January 21 2017',"b'Real Ting is the first project of the impressive rising young London MC Stefanie Allen (aka Stefflon Don). The mixtape is a slightly rocky intro, but her raw talent shines through.'","b'In late 2015, then-ascendant South London rappers Section Boyz made their presence felt with \xe2\x80\x9cLock Arff,\xe2\x80\x9d the breakout single that netted them a place on BBC\xe2\x80\x99s Sound of 2016 longlist at the end of that year. It\xe2\x80\x99s usually an indicator of success when a song gets remixed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLock Arff,\xe2\x80\x9d a sprawling opus that boasts contributions from each member of the six-person crew, left little room for anyone else to get a look-in between verses. But a version with two new verses by Stefanie Allen (aka Stefflon Don), stripped of everything but the original beat and chorus, impressed the Section Boyz enough that they cosigned its official video treatment. The remix and video in turn raised Stefflon Don\xe2\x80\x99s profile enough to land her on the 2017\xc2\xa0Sound of\xe2\x80\xa6 longlist at the end of last year.' b'In between, the young London MC stayed busy\xe2\x80\x94churning out more remixes or hopping on songs by compatriots like Angel and grime veteran Lethal Bizzle. All of that that momentum culminated in Real Ting, her first full length solo project, released just before 2016 drew to a close.' b'With a running time of under 40 minutes, the tape\xe2\x80\x99s rocky start is acutely felt, taking up more space than it should in proportion to the remaining nine tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cIntro\xe2\x80\x9d is a somewhat cartoonish announcement of Allen\xe2\x80\x99s formal arrival on the scene (\xe2\x80\x9cLook to the sky, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bird, it\xe2\x80\x99s a plane, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Don!\xe2\x80\x9d) set to an excerpt from Nile Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Coming To America score. The melody plays during the scene in which King Jaffe Joffer tracks Prince Akeem down in Queens; from the eastern borough Allen bears south for inspiration on \xe2\x80\x9cReal Ting.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s startlingly derivative of Brooklynite Young M.A\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOOOUUU\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94from the punchline delivery to the ad libs.' b'Comparison to established artists can be a boon or a blight for an emerging talent, foreshadowing similar levels of success in the former case or inviting dismissal in the latter. Since \xe2\x80\x9cLock Arff\xe2\x80\x9d went viral, discussion of Stefflon Don has often touched on the parallels between her and Nicki Minaj: owing to her cadence, a penchant for brightly-colored hairstyles and a tendency to slip back in and out of Jamaican patois, which can resemble Minaj\xe2\x80\x99s Trinidadian Creole to the untrained ear. Thankfully in Allen\xe2\x80\x99s case the similarities seem both incidental and positive; no rapper could or should corner the market for bravado, and Stefflon Don clearly possesses a lot of it.' b'Real Ting picks up steam by track three \xe2\x80\x9cTight Nooki,\xe2\x80\x9d an upbeat dancehall jaunt featuring Jeremih. It capitalizes on the unstoppable \xe2\x80\x9cBam Bam\xe2\x80\x9d riddim, made famous by Chaka Demus & Pliers in the early \xe2\x80\x9990s, and complements the pair\xe2\x80\x99s previous collaboration on Jeremih\xe2\x80\x99s Late Nights: Europe mixtape. \xe2\x80\x9cFamily Ties\xe2\x80\x9d is deeply personal, touching on a childhood marked by violence and her mother\xe2\x80\x99s legal troubles (\xe2\x80\x9cShe was looking at ten but the lawyer beat the case/By the grace and the power or the mercy of the state.\xe2\x80\x9d) The family affair is rounded out by her brother Dutch, who goes into detail about his own run-ins with the law, and UK House star Donae\xe2\x80\x99o. \xe2\x80\x9cEnvy Us,\xe2\x80\x9d another dancehall-tinged standout with an assist from Tottenham upstart Abra Cadabra, is a good example of the rhythmic space for which Stefflon Don\xe2\x80\x99s voice is well-suited. But the tape\xe2\x80\x99s overall scattered quality positions it as a teaser of things to come rather than a cohesive collection.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell if or where the line between a mixtape and an album should be drawn\xe2\x80\x94in 2017 a mixtape can be the vehicle for an artist\xe2\x80\x99s unpolished experiments, or be in with a serious chance of winning a Grammy. On *Real Ting, *listeners get a proper introduction to Stefflon Don and a fuller understanding of her artistry. She sings as well as she raps, is a scholar of many genres (trap, dancehall, house and more) and has wide-ranging influences; the outtake from a Margaret Thatcher interview on \xe2\x80\x9cLik Down\xe2\x80\x9d and even the antics of \xe2\x80\x9cIntro\xe2\x80\x9d are revelatory of her cultural interests beyond the music. So if Real Ting is her CV, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun to watch her find her footing at work.'"
b'Naaahhh',6.2,b'Themes',0,b'Electronic',b'January 21 2017',"b'The\xc2\xa0debut EP from cryptic\xc2\xa0London artist Naaahhh offers\xc2\xa0five tracks of murky electronic ambience, though\xc2\xa0it contains\xc2\xa0unmistakable traces of UK rave culture.'","b'Kiran Sande, the shadowy figure pulling the strings behind London electronic outpost\xc2\xa0Blackest Ever Black, is one of those label bosses who\xc2\xa0can make a record sound essential through sheer turn of phrase. The debut release by Naaahhh comes with next to zero biographical information\xe2\x80\x94just the promise that he, she, or they hail from \xe2\x80\x9cunder London,\xe2\x80\x9d plus a found photo of a hippy raver, cross-legged and grinning on an Afghan rug, with a half-rolled joint laid out in front of her. Luckily, Sande\xe2\x80\x99s liner-notes make up for some of\xc2\xa0the gaps in the narrative, promising \xe2\x80\x9csidereal downers for all hardcore ravers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparanoid street music meets the cosmic disturbances of musique concr\xc3\xa8te, the MDMA spine-freeze of isolationism and England\xe2\x80\x99s hidden reverse.\xe2\x80\x9d With a billing like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to resist.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that Naaahhh\xe2\x80\x99s music struggles to live up to the accompanying prose, exactly. But Themes\xc2\xa0has you squinting into its depths in search of the promised ingredients, like a fortune-teller sifting through tea leaves. Here we have five tracks of murky ambience, devoid of anything you might recognize as a beat, but rhythmic nonetheless\xe2\x80\x94an ooze of sound with dark, rippling tides mottling its surface. Casting around for antecedents, you might compare \xe2\x80\x9cEmpty Rituals\xe2\x80\x9d to the more haunted and abstract works of Coil or Nurse With Wound, veteran British industrial units for whom sound was a carrier for occult or spiritual currents; or \xe2\x80\x9cNeck Devour\xe2\x80\x9d to the blasted, Gristle-y dub of Wolf Eyes circa Dead Hills.' b'True to Sande\xe2\x80\x99s description, though, there are unmistakable traces of UK rave culture buried in Themes\xe2\x80\x99 fabric. The throbbing, faintly seasick synth washes of \xe2\x80\x9cBlooz\xe2\x80\x9d imagine some ancient jungle or hardcore 12\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0with the beats and bass peeled away, leaving just floating, faintly toxic atmosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Theme\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTheme 2,\xe2\x80\x9d meanwhile, could be club music as viewed from the \xe2\x80\x9cStranger Things\xe2\x80\x9d alternate dimension of Upside Down. Muffled rhythms pulse interminably, gooey bass notes affect a dismal plod, and high quavering melody lines ghost around in the higher registers\xe2\x80\x94a grotesque parody of rave\xe2\x80\x99s ecstatic euphoria.' b'Over and out in 28 minutes, Themes draws to a close before your first impressions have quite had time to coalesce. This is neither uncommon nor necessarily unwelcome for a label that deals in the cryptic. But there is the sense that this is a project still finding its form. Whether Naaahhh follows on the heels of former Blackest Ever Black\xc2\xa0groups like Dalhous and Raime in\xc2\xa0blossoming into something dimly\xc2\xa0beautiful, or Themes remains a one-off emission from the dark side, remains to be seen.'"
