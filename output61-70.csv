b'Jacques Greene',7.6,b'Feel Infinite',0,b'Electronic',b'March 27 2017',b'The French-Canadian DJ Philippe Aubin-Dionne debuts his long-overdue love letter to the dance floor.',"b'Feel Infinite may be the debut Jacques Greene album, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the first we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the project\xe2\x80\x99s 27-year-old mastermind, Philippe Aubin-Dionne. Since his breakout single on the 2010\xc2\xa0Night Slugs Allstars compilation, the French-Canadian DJ and producer has graduated from throwing parties in his native Montreal to touring the world with a steady stream of singles and EPs on indie dance labels.' b'It might seem odd to release your debut LP seven years into an ascendant career. However, for a working club DJ, most money is made on the live circuit and most fans are accustomed to getting all their music for free, so it\xe2\x80\x99s considered a luxury to have the time and resources to produce a full-length. Aubin-Dionne\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaries Kaytranada and Kingdom followed this route, making late, full narratives reflective of their identities.' b'On Jacques Greene\xe2\x80\x99s first LP, the narrative is of an introvert who\xe2\x80\x99s found human connections in the club; he\xe2\x80\x99s found an escape not from reality, but from loneliness. It\xe2\x80\x99s very much of the Montreal scene that birthed his career, one that was inclusive geographically. The Turbo Crunk parties he threw with Rob Squire, Hadji Baraka, and other dance peers were defined by border-busting beats build on Southern bounce, Bay Area hyphy, and Missy Elliott, all laced with a cappella rapping.' b'The songs on Feel Infinite are colorful and melodic, built on simple structures. He uses a minimalist palette\xe2\x80\x94often just a drum track, synthesizer, and vocal sample. Seemingly rooted in house and techno, and punctuated with R&B vocals, the album plays with the building blocks of UK bass music and gives it his own spin. Feel Infinite is the work of an internet autodidact, one who\xe2\x80\x99s culled his collection from peer-to-peer filesharing and admits it freely; he\xe2\x80\x99s a music nerd who follows rabbit holes on Wikipedia and taught himself modular synthesizers by reading message boards. His crate-digging goes down online, from sampling random strangers\xe2\x80\x99 tunes on YouTube to recording an exotic dancer\xe2\x80\x99s vocals on her smartphone, and those samples are at the heart of Feel Infinite.' b'From the first deep breaths of opener \xe2\x80\x9cFall\xe2\x80\x9d to the warbled wobble of \xe2\x80\x9cAfterglow,\xe2\x80\x9d voices set the emotional tone for the entire album. Aubin-Dionne is gifted at chopping up R&B vocals on top of dancefloor thumpers, and more than ever, he seems to be aware of its emotional impact. Feel Infinite is an openly tender album, meant to evoke the liberation of sharing music in a communal space even as you listen at home, alone, with headphones. It\xe2\x80\x99s his 11-song love letter to the club, the place he spent his formative years.' b'Though it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer the premier sales unit it once was\xe2\x80\x94and for dance music DJs, maybe it never was\xe2\x80\x94the full-length album still holds enough cache for Aubin-Dionne to put his touring schedule on hold to hunker down and record it. He tried once before, with the sessions that would ultimately become Phantom Vibrate, but it felt forced, like he was trying too hard to make something serious. That EP felt cold and isolated, most evident in its distant, hollow vocals. He\xe2\x80\x99s escaped that trap by focusing on the self-contained universes in which he\xe2\x80\x99s grown into an adult: the club. Feel Infinite is warm and inviting, a taut mix of R&B love songs to finding your true self on the floor.'"
b'Sneaks',7.3,"b""It's a Myth""",0,b'Rock',b'March 27 2017',"b""Using just a bass and a drum machine, Eva Moolchan's punk is bare and hypnotic. On her first record on Merge, she maintains her raw sound in the powerful space she built for herself.""","b""Brevity defines the music that Washington, D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s Eva Moolchan makes as Sneaks. On her new album It's a Myth, Moolchan logs ten tracks across 18 minutes. On her debut Gymnastics, she didn't pass 14 minutes. Her take on post-punk is minimalist and sparse\xe2\x80\x94music that proves there's a virtue in being concise. These details suggest that it would be unnatural for Moolchan to accommodate anything beyond 20 minutes, and the transient nature of her work means there is little to compare her to both past or present."" b""It's a Myth represents the first Sneaks record for Merge since the label signed Moolchan eight months ago. Sneaks was born out of the desire for full creative control after playing in the short-lived Shit Stains whose first performance to five people included Katie Alice Greer of Priests. Greer introduced Moolchan into the capital's DIY scene, becoming a fixture in the community, while coming up with Priests themselves, Flasher, and Downtown Boys."" b""For It's a Myth, Sneaks recorded the album with Mary Timony (Helium, Ex Hex) and Jonah Takagi, with Timony producing it at her D.C. studio. Extra hands mean more instrumentation and allow for exploring new textures to create a more fluid album. It's a Myth is not a huge leap in sound because Moolchan opts for refinement rather than repurposing the roughness of Gymnastics. According to her Bandcamp tags, they fall within \xe2\x80\x9ccold cut,\xe2\x80\x9d(?) \xe2\x80\x9czing zong\xe2\x80\x9d (??), and \xe2\x80\x9cviolent vibes.\xe2\x80\x9d These descriptors allow Moolchan's music to be flexible in her expression and secure her experimentalism."" b'The Sneaks template is no more than bass, a drum machine, and vocals. Despite the minimal approach, Moolchan\xe2\x80\x99s voice extends beyond the half-rapping, half-singing approach on Gymnastics. On \xe2\x80\x9cInside Edition,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0she delivers a hypnotic mantra that becomes the song\xe2\x80\x99s groove and uses\xc2\xa0her voice as a melodic tool. That new feature of her work enables the creation of \xe2\x80\x9cPBNJ,\xe2\x80\x9d in which Moolchan\xe2\x80\x99s voice sounds distant, and the music behind her sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s in a trance state. Moolchan\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics are elliptical and playful, suggesting that she writes them in line with a song\xe2\x80\x99s rhythm or to her voice\xe2\x80\x99s melodic sensibilities.' b'Moolchan\xe2\x80\x99s music may not appear to be as overtly political as the acts around her, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say she is apolitical. On \xe2\x80\x9cHair Slick Back,\xe2\x80\x9d Moolchan sings, \xe2\x80\x9cYou think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to say/No you think you need a bigger stage/You think I can\xe2\x80\x99t contain my rage.\xe2\x80\x9d The words could be a taunt at the males that dominate DIY scenes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you go to a show, and it\xe2\x80\x99s filled with all these punk bros,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Moolchan told The Media in 2015. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be taking up the space, and not these guys.\xe2\x80\x9d Moolchan\xe2\x80\x99s presence alone is an act of protest, but with \xe2\x80\x9cHair Slick Back\xe2\x80\x9d she offers a statement to rebut those with privilege who think they need more visibility.' b'Because of Moolchan\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to concision, a three-minute song like \xe2\x80\x9cLook Like That\xe2\x80\x9d is a rare example of when Sneaks expands beyond her realms. It\xe2\x80\x99s unfamiliar territory, and as a result, the song is less taut and impactful. It\xe2\x80\x99s a Myth\xc2\xa0is the natural progression from Gymnastics, and so across the record, Moolchan refines her sound within these limits. Inside and outside of the music, she embraces the self-built space that she crafted for herself.' b'Correction: A previous version of the review misidentified label on which\xc2\xa0Gynmastics was released.'"
b'Glenn Gould',10.0,b'Bach: The Goldberg Variations',0,b'Jazz',b'March 26 2017',"b'Two virtuosic performances of a Bach composition by the eccentric Canadian pianist brought Baroque music into the modern\xc2\xa0era. Together, they explore\xc2\xa0how art and taste evolve through time.'","b'The press release began: \xe2\x80\x9cColumbia Masterworks\xe2\x80\x99 recording director and his engineering colleagues are sympathetic veterans who accept as perfectly natural all artists\xe2\x80\x99 studio rituals, foibles, or fancies. But even these hardy souls were surprised by the arrival of young Canadian pianist Glenn Gould and his \xe2\x80\x98recording equipment\xe2\x80\x99 for his first Columbia sessions. \xe2\x80\xa6 It was a balmy June day, but Gould arrived in a coat, beret, muffler and gloves.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the bulletin detailed the other peculiarities that Gould had brought along with him\xc2\xa0when recording J.S. Bach\xe2\x80\x99s Goldberg Variations for the label.' b'These were many. Instead of nobly holding his head high with a proper recitalist\xe2\x80\x99s posture, Gould\xe2\x80\x99s modified piano bench allowed him to get his face right near the keys, where he would proceed to hum audibly while playing. He soaked his arms in hot water for up to 20 minutes before takes and brought a wide variety of pills. He also brought his own bottles of water, which, for 1955, was still something that seemed like only Howard Hughes would do. It was these initial, broadly trumpeted peculiarities that helped shape the Gould myth throughout his too-short life, the audacious genius who slightly unsettled everyone around him. Fittingly, throughout the 20th century, there would be no more audacious and initially unsettling act of musical reinterpretation than Gould\xe2\x80\x99s debut studio recording.' b'With his 1955 recording of Bach\xe2\x80\x99s Goldberg Variations, the young pianist made a compelling case for a work that, at the time, was considered an obscure keyboard composition by an otherwise imposing master of Baroque music. Gould made his counter-argument for the piece\xe2\x80\x99s rightful prominence by taking wild liberties with the source. In addition to playing the work on a piano instead of on the 18th-century era-appropriate harpsichord, Gould rushed tempos and varied his attack with aggression. His body flailed up and down his creaky chair, displaying melodramatic physical gestures\xe2\x80\x94the very cliche of a young genius at work. But instead of seeming like an impudent youngster, Gould\xe2\x80\x99s innovations signaled a clear love for the source material. He took the piece\xe2\x80\x99s unusual status\xe2\x80\x94a theme-and-variation work so varied that it could be hard for a lay audience to follow\xe2\x80\x94and realized that it could be performed with modernist vigor, full of wild twists of character.' b'Gould drilled his famous technique over time, using an obscure practice known as \xe2\x80\x9cfinger tapping\xe2\x80\x9d to produce muscle memory in his fingers\xe2\x80\x94thereby allowing for dizzying flurries of notes with astonishing control and minimal physical exertion. And at a time when the future members of the Beatles were still obsessing over British skiffle bands, Gould was pioneering the use of the studio as an instrument by splicing together different takes: finding startling collisions of mood that could help drive his conception of a work.' b'In its fervor for relating Gould\xe2\x80\x99s peculiar behaviors, Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s first press release neglected to mention all the substantive ways in which the pianist was revolutionizing the art of interpretation. The critics, however, did notice. Gould\xe2\x80\x99s Goldbergs received a raft of rave reviews from the New York Times, Newsweek, and Musical America, among others. Even writers who were unsure if his was a respectable way to approach Bach\xe2\x80\x99s sublime music counted themselves impressed by Gould\xe2\x80\x99s array of approaches\xe2\x80\x94including his dancing sprightliness, a dashing top-gear of speed, and swooning sense of drama. And Gould proved a forceful advocate for his own ideas about the piece.' b'In erudite liner notes that accompanied the first LP issue in 1956, Gould writes about the strangeness of Bach\xe2\x80\x99s theme-and-variation work:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c...one might justifiably expect that \xe2\x80\xa6 the principal pursuit of the variations would be the illumination of the motivic facets within the melodic complex of the Aria theme. However such is not the case, for the thematic substance, a docile but richly embellished soprano line, possesses an intrinsic homogeneity which bequeaths nothing to posterity and which, so far as motivic representation is concerned, is totally forgotten during the 30 variations.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""It\xe2\x80\x99s a fascinating read of the piece\xe2\x80\x94even if it seems trollish to accuse Bach\xe2\x80\x99s Aria for adding \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to posterity.\xe2\x80\x9d (At least Gould was consistent in his dislike of obvious, top-line melodies. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t much care for Italian opera, either.) Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s true that the power associated with the culmination of Gould's Goldbergs\xe2\x80\x94when the Aria returns\xe2\x80\x94has something to do with how far the listener has traveled since the opening. If you want to make that Aria really floor people at the end, why not blow out the contrasts between the variations as you play them?"" b'Gould makes an argument for his own radical vision of how the piece should be played. He sees his own jagged cadence not in defiance of but as a requisite to Bach\xe2\x80\x99s score. Even listeners who put the Goldbergs on as background music are likely to sit up and pay attention when Gould pours it on during Variation No. 5. With that one far edge of intensity established, his ruminative way of handling Bach\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCanons\xe2\x80\x9d is\xc2\xa0far more seductive. Gould\xe2\x80\x99s lightning-fast runs tend to get all the press, but they cast into sharp relief his poetic handling of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cblack pearl\xe2\x80\x9d Variation No. 25. The power of Gould\xe2\x80\x99s 1955 Goldbergs comes from the contrasts that Gould chooses to emphasize.' b'Gould\xe2\x80\x99s first version of the Goldbergs reportedly sold 40,000 copies in its first five years: A considerable amount for any classical recording at any time, but particularly notable at the dawn of the LP era. The pop-cultural primacy of Gould\xe2\x80\x99s first take on the Goldbergs also fostered some detractors, among them some Bach specialists like Wanda Landowska who were also interested in rescuing the piece from its relative obscurity. Late in life, Gould joined their ranks, offering some withering criticisms of his 1955 recording. In 1981, the pianist told the critic and biographer Tim Page that the 1955 handling of the \xe2\x80\x9cblack pearl\xe2\x80\x9d variation had become particularly unwelcome to his own ears: \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to say\xe2\x80\x94Please Take Note: This Is Tragedy. You know, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the dignity to bear its suffering with a hint of quiet resignation.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The idea of judging his famous 1955 recording on the basis of those criteria seems like a category error\xe2\x80\x94or a set-up destined to prompt a negative assessment of his first record. The latter possibility is at least plausible,\xc2\xa0since when Gould offered this self-criticism to Page, he was doing so as part of a new publicity campaign. After being so closely identified with the Goldbergs for decades, Gould had made the rare decision to re-record a work already in his repertoire.' b'His 1981 recording of the Goldberg Variations is still recognizable as Gould: the strutting precision and emphasis on counterpoint apparent. So too is Gould\xe2\x80\x99s famously divisive practice of humming along with his playing (a natural trait of Gould\xe2\x80\x99s that seemed to flower into a deliberate affectation sometime between 1955 and 1981). But in the interim, much else has changed. There\xe2\x80\x99s less swing in Gould\xe2\x80\x99s playing; even when he turns up the tempi, it feels considered and autumnal.' b'Variation No. 5 is played in 37 seconds, the identical span of time Gould needed to burn through it in 1955. But in the 1981 variations, Gould makes good on his desire for dignity. The 1955 rendition of No. 5 has a compelling, nervy energy; the 1981\xc2\xa0version takes a greater sense of self-possession. The ability to find that much expressive room inside a similar tempo resulted in Gould\xe2\x80\x99s second masterstroke with the Goldbergs.This range of musical investigation signals something profound. Two different approaches to the same notes can say a great deal about how one ages\xc2\xa0and how tastes can move over time.' b'Gould died just days after Columbia released the second Goldberg set. His death enhanced the idea of this being a grand, final statement\xe2\x80\x94as though touching the work again had created a fateful resolution for his startling debut. But even if Gould were still with us, the 1981 Goldberg performance would sound necessary. Here, Gould luxuriates in the stately character of the \xe2\x80\x9cFrench\xe2\x80\x9d overture\xc2\xa0(No. 16)\xe2\x80\x94and its pivot away from the prior, minor-key canon\xe2\x80\x94with greater pomp than on his first try. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that the fun never spills over into abandon, as on Gould\xe2\x80\x99s first pass.\xc2\xa0For all his eccentricities, Gould\xe2\x80\x99s most striking trait may have been his ability to revise his own carefully considered understanding of a work that was important to him.' b'Both interpretations have their uses. Along with Bob Dylan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLove and Theft\xe2\x80\x9d, which I\xe2\x80\x99d purchased at 12:01 am on Sept. 11, 2001, at the Virgin Megastore in Union Square, Gould\xe2\x80\x99s 1981 Goldberg set was the album I played most often in the days that followed. With the ashen smell still in the air, and the streets south of 14th Street devoid of car traffic, most who lived inside the perimeter established by the National Guard spent some portion of each day balancing requirements of mourning and anger with the search for a new equilibrium\xe2\x80\x94a way to feel less anxious that didn\xe2\x80\x99t also involve pretending that something traumatic hadn\xe2\x80\x99t just taken place.' b'I owned both versions of Gould\xe2\x80\x99s Goldbergs because I had been told by guidebooks that this was a prerequisite for caring about classical music (it is.) Until that week, I\xe2\x80\x99d spent most of my time with the 1955 recording\xe2\x80\x94identifying with its direct access to youthful exuberance. Now, however, the high energy of that edition seemed a poor fit to the mood. The dignity Gould had intended to emphasize in 1981 came through clearly.' b'Record collecting and music appreciation often turn on arguments about rankings, peerlessness, and the greatest-of-all-time. Classical fans play this game as aggressively as anyone\xe2\x80\x94so hard that they occasionally seem to rule out the possibility of any worthy new music being made for traditional classical instruments. And we do this with Gould\xe2\x80\x99s Goldbergs, too. Think fast: 1955 or 1981? Sometimes that\xe2\x80\x99s fun. But these recordings\xe2\x80\x99 mutual portrait of variations held in a single mind\xe2\x80\x94one capable of such deliberate differences of opinion with itself\xe2\x80\x94seems not just like something you\xe2\x80\x99re well advised to have in a music collection, but instead like an approach to life worth exploring and emulating.'"

Consider it a companion piece to Jarvis Cocker and Chilly Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0Room 29, a\xc2\xa0meditation on the relationship between hotel and guest, comprised of piano, voice, bits of strings from the\xc2\xa0Kaiser Quartett,\xc2\xa0and sound effects. Of course, these seemingly blank slates still hold memories and emotions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where this collaboration gets interesting. Sorting through metaphorical traces left behind, Cocker asks on the title track, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there anything sadder than a hotel room that hasn't been fucked in?\xe2\x80\x9d"" b'Some of the real-life stories from the\xc2\xa0Chateau Marmont, the infamous Los Angeles hotel where this room 29 is located (with a grand piano, no less), are indeed quite sad.\xc2\xa0In one of\xc2\xa0*Room 29\xe2\x80\x99*s several tabloid tales, Cocker speak-sings of dear \xe2\x80\x9cClara,\xe2\x80\x9d the pianist daughter of Mark Twain, who attempted to rouse the spirit of her dead husband at the Chateau.

Do they figure out relationships? Pretend like everything is okay? Perhaps take comfort in the free breakfast anyway? Lope about the lobby in a state of surreal emptiness while listening to cinematic numbers like \xe2\x80\x9cA Trick of the Light\xe2\x80\x9d? The music and the tone of voice seem\xc2\xa0to suggest this melancholy state.

But as much as this is supposed to be an experimental and theatrical tour of\xc2\xa0Room 29, both Cocker and Gonzales have way too much pop-song mastery for this to be just a fussy one-time stay.\xc2\xa0Cocker brings his wry Pulp persona to bear on Gonzales\xe2\x80\x99 elegant piano and film-score approach and deep pop tune understanding.\xc2\xa0A few tracks are infectious enough to merit standalone listens.'"

The Vancouver trio includes but one Courtney, n\xc3\xa9e Courtney Garvin, who rips vivid fuzz-guitar riffs alongside bassist Sydney Koke and singer/drummer Jen Twynn Payne. Their music\xe2\x80\x94a bit gray, slightly lopsided\xe2\x80\x94recalls velvety 1980s kiwi acts such as the Clean and Look Blue Go Purple. Crucially, though, the Courtneys bust out of the ramshackle Dunedin sound with bold, driving arrangements and thrilling pop sense. They have covered U2\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Will Follow\xe2\x80\x9d live and mention the influence of Teenage Fanclub and Big Star. Accordingly, the\xc2\xa0Courtneys feel like a punkish band with clearly-outlined emotions\xc2\xa0and a cheekily arena-rock spirit. On their supremely catchy second album, II, they lock into\xc2\xa0a real groove. They tactfully pair simplicity and strength. They make sad songs sound like a blast.' b'Something about the presence of a singer/drummer always communicates a discernible\xc2\xa0vulnerability. It emphasizes just how badly this person wants a\xc2\xa0voice\xe2\x80\x94enough to carry\xc2\xa0both a tune\xc2\xa0and a beat\xe2\x80\x94and turns a song into an act of conviction.

The sun-streaked riffs of \xe2\x80\x9cTour\xe2\x80\x9d pry\xc2\xa0open like a\xc2\xa0window on a long highway\xc2\xa0drive. It sprawls, capturing the restlessness that comes with transience, grounding\xc2\xa0a self-help mantra: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you are and what you want to be/It takes a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0On \xe2\x80\x9c25,\xe2\x80\x9d Payne fruitlessly\xc2\xa0chases the object of her affection, and she evokes the true emotional horror of a two-sided gemini: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a gemini/And I change my mind/Always change my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'As Payne attempts to cope with heartache, the chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cMinnesota\xe2\x80\x9d is distilled yearning. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go away/I hope that you will know,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThat I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you so/Not easy to pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to let you go.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0These are evergreen subjects within an evergreen sound, to be sure, but II\xc2\xa0proves their cyclical natures\xe2\x80\x94especially given\xc2\xa0its\xc2\xa0remarkable energy. The songs are\xc2\xa0viscerally anguished, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t wallow. There\xe2\x80\x99s an essential, breezy levity to the music; the parts require one\xc2\xa0another. The whole of\xc2\xa0II moves forward and on.' b'The democratic alchemy of the Courtneys makes this music feel humbly triumphant\xe2\x80\x94like they collectively work through the confusion that Payne describes. Speaking with Westender, Garvin\xc2\xa0shared a story that underscores both their wry humor and this\xc2\xa0internal logic. She\xc2\xa0is a 2D animator by day, and once, Nickelodeon asked her to pitch a series. Garvin devised a cartoon based on the Courtneys, but differences with the network kept it in limbo.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a show with three characters, one needs to be the leader and the other two have simplified characteristics,\xe2\x80\x9d Garvin\xc2\xa0said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just realized right away that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work for our band. It\xe2\x80\x99s really important that we\xe2\x80\x99re very equal.\xe2\x80\x9d They animate an\xc2\xa0egalitarian spirit on II instead.'"
b'Octo Octa',7.6,b'Where Are We Going?',0,b'Electronic',b'March 25 2017',"b'The house producer Maya Bouldry-Morrison, aka Octo Octa, both describes and comforts anxiety. On this new LP, her\xc2\xa0candied synths and incandescent songs\xc2\xa0spiral towards infinity.'","b'Several years ago, the producer Octo Octa compiled a mix beginning with one of the earliest house singles, Marshall Jefferson\xc2\xa0as Hercules\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0sinister \xe2\x80\x9c7 Ways.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cVisually touch the body in front of you,\xe2\x80\x9d Jefferson commands, \xe2\x80\x9ccaress it with your eyes, drink it in slowly.\xe2\x80\x9d He savors the words like a cobra does movement. There are enough layers of dominance and submission to delight Throbbing Gristle. Octo Octa\xe2\x80\x99s own work swims the gulf separating dance music\xe2\x80\x99s utopian, transcendental side\xc2\xa0from the bodies grinding up against capitalist demands and social alienation\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps each other, too, if a night\xe2\x80\x99s shape allows. She describes and comforts anxiety.' b'You could call that an acquired skill. Before Maya Bouldry-Morrison was Octo Octa, her solo material drew more from the drums-frenzied school of techno. Her early records often borrowed R&B a capellas, like \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Trying,\xe2\x80\x9d which reduced Amerie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c1 Thing\xe2\x80\x9d to abashed moans. Her use of compression could be subtly disorienting, giving different sounds tangible presence for only a moment, like ghosts.' b'With her new album Where Are We Going?, Bouldry-Morrison\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic has grown more resolved. Her\xc2\xa0candy-bright synths remain, but the songs have grown increasingly circuitous, elaborating on their own structures. \xe2\x80\x9cAdrift\xe2\x80\x9d sends a pulse descending through the depths of murky reverb; \xe2\x80\x9cFleeting Moments of Freedom (Wooo)\xe2\x80\x9d keeps circling back and starting over again, as if spiraling towards infinity. (It would explain the deadpan title.) Unlike earlier Octo Octa records, vocals are rare, often abstracted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cNo More Pain (Promises to a Younger Self)\xe2\x80\x9d distorts Mariah Carey over hip-house drums like a kite in a wind tunnel. This distracted introspection is the kind you only experience while dancing, as when the brooding \xe2\x80\x9cOn Your Lips\xe2\x80\x9d makes a synth\xe2\x80\x99s timbre blush incandescently.' b'*Where Are We Going?\xe2\x80\x94*the question could be asked in rhetorical despair, or outside a club flirtatiously at 3 a.m. This is the first Octo Octa album since Bouldry-Morrison came out as trans, and on the second part of its title track she interrupts the glistening piano melodies with a refrain: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you feel better? Are you going to feel better?\xe2\x80\x9d As she\xc2\xa0turns this interrogation back towards the listener, it reminds me of\xc2\xa0the vocal samples on DJ Sprinkles\xe2\x80\x99 Midtown 120 Blues, which placed beautiful deep house and historical\xc2\xa0grievances in dialectical intimacy. Bouldry-Morrison never feels bound to offer an answer, but through\xc2\xa0the vivid ambivalence of her music,\xc2\xa0you can sense\xc2\xa0a warming\xc2\xa0to new possibility. It\xe2\x80\x99s like someone catching sight of themselves at a mirrored corner of the dance floor, smiling faintly, and returning to the party.'"
b'Cameron Avery',6.5,"b'Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams'",0,b'Rock',b'March 25 2017',"b'Tame Impala bassist Cameron Avery\xc2\xa0veers away from psych-rock with an album of throwback ballads, a modern twist on the tried and true songwriting of crooners from the \xe2\x80\x9940s and \xe2\x80\x9950s.'","b'Not all albums must strive for greater meaning. Plenty attempt and fall short. A great many seek a comforting adequacy\xe2\x80\x94and even those don\xe2\x80\x99t always pan out. On his solo debut, Tame Impala bassist Cameron Avery\xc2\xa0veers away from psych-rock cosmic revelations in search of a pure musical greatness of times past. Upon the record\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, he made clear his inspirations: Elvis, Sinatra, Etta James, \xe2\x80\x9cthe big band stuff with less metaphorical lyrics,\xe2\x80\x9d as he put it. From the gentle\xc2\xa0guitar plucks of \xe2\x80\x9cA Time and Place,\xe2\x80\x9d Avery\xe2\x80\x99s greatest pursuit is beauty over all else, which he achieves often throughout Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams.' b'Avery is best when ruminating on loves lost, found, and desired. The album\xe2\x80\x99s limited musical and thematic palette, however, means the burden for excellence falls on Avery\xe2\x80\x99s songwriting, which ranges from subtle, self-aware inversions of machismo to overt chauvinism, and in its worst moments, it\xe2\x80\x99s just bland. Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams is a deliberately pleasant album that occasionally soars but at a relatively low ceiling.' b'In making an album that revels in classicalism, Avery reconciles with the old-timey mores of society. On \xe2\x80\x9cDisposable,\xe2\x80\x9d the record\xe2\x80\x99s jauntiest track, he sees himself as the most ordinary bane of humanity: a dude. It\xe2\x80\x99s effective in its extreme self-deprecation, as he sings happily about being \xe2\x80\x9cjust as shit as any other brand,\xe2\x80\x9d and making a soaring hook out of \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disposable.\xe2\x80\x9d Avery sees the haplessness of the male pursuit, that of the bumbling fool who sings to the mountaintops about why he just can\xe2\x80\x99t find the right gal. He achieves the endeavor best on\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWasted on Fidelity,\xe2\x80\x9d a track where he is in love, yet is unable to resign himself to the domesticity. On these songs, Avery breathes new life into the male pop figure as someone who sees his flaws but cannot help but do the wrong thing anyway.' b'He runs into trouble when he loses the self-awareness of it all. The subversion is absent on \xe2\x80\x9cBig Town Girl,\xe2\x80\x9d with lines like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had the time to wait around for a dame/But if I knew that we could make it, I\xe2\x80\x99d wait around for Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d as if trying on a terrible-looking fedora. Platitudes like, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know she\xe2\x80\x99s a lady,\xe2\x80\x9d also highlight this lounge singer mode, but the song is far too conventional for his affectations to land with any honesty. Similarly, his take on Elvis in \xe2\x80\x9cWatch Me Take It Away\xe2\x80\x9d offers little nuance, only chintzy cock rock.' b""Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams finds its true comfort zone when it is simply sweet. The opening tracks \xe2\x80\x9cA Time and Place\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDo You Know Me by Heart,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as the closing \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est Toi (Extended)\xe2\x80\x9d are tried and true love songs that take their time. They fully embrace the majesty of the American songbook without jamming in any rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll, winkingly or otherwise. His smoky baritone does the songs justice, though he's still more of an imitator of the past than he is a student of the past.\xc2\xa0Hamilton Leithauser + Rostam\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 collaboration, for contrast, added excitement and contemporary sounds to revive bygone trends. Making an album like this, an album of ancient ballads requires subtle innovation.\xc2\xa0Ripe Dreams, Pipe Dreams is a focused record with several wonderful songs. It\xe2\x80\x99s not novel, nor does it attempt to be, just like those old 45s it so fondly recalls."""

How often have you found yourself in the middle of a good book or movie, warming up to its world, making the magical passage through which its characters\xe2\x80\x99 lives become temporarily real only to be sped into artificial reverence by someone dying? Gosh, you think: Death: That\xe2\x80\x99s big. This must be a pretty meaningful experience. Death is reduced to a sympathy-extraction device, what the New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani once described as \xe2\x80\x9cliterary ambulance-chasing,\xe2\x80\x9d designed to crowbar into the hearts of an audience just as they were thinking about changing the channel. Real death, meanwhile, moves ominously through the world of the living like a tide, gathering in waves that break without warning or reason, paroxysms of grief followed by yet more shapeless life. Fake death pops. Real death remains a slog.' b'Onto this tightrope walks Phil Elverum, a hermetically introspective songwriter who records under the name Mount Eerie. In spring of 2015, Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s wife Genevi\xc3\xa8ve was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a disease that kills 80% of patients within a year. According to the American Cancer Society, nearly all people with pancreatic cancer are over 45; two-thirds are over 65. Genevi\xc3\xa8ve died three months after her 35th birthday. A year and a half earlier, she had given birth to her and Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s first child, a girl.' b'A Crow Looked at Me, Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s ninth album as Mount Eerie\xe2\x80\x94and 13th overall, counting his earlier music as the Microphones\xe2\x80\x94mentions Genevi\xc3\xa8ve in nearly every song, sometimes by name, sometimes through cold, negative space. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as though Elverum has nothing better to talk about. Which, of course, he probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.' b'Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s recent albums\xe2\x80\x942015\xe2\x80\x99s Sauna, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s double feature of Clear Moon and Ocean Roar\xe2\x80\x94were heavy on ambiance and fuzz, sonic embodiments of things through which we can\xe2\x80\x99t see. Crow is spare and clean, mostly voice and some guitar, the sound of coffee in winter. You can almost hear the floorboards creaking. In a recent interview, Elverum called it \xe2\x80\x9cbarely music.\xe2\x80\x9d Given the floss-thin line between his art and experience, you could take it as the album\xe2\x80\x99s intended genre: Barely music.' b'Over the past few years, there have been a handful of albums similar to Crow, or at least with a similarly autobiographical premise: Sun Kil Moon\xe2\x80\x99s Benji, Sufjan Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 Carrie & Lowell, Nick Cave\xe2\x80\x99s Skeleton Tree, stark, diaristic albums haunted by literal death, grief on record. Indie culture tends to prize this kind of undecorated directness as a stand-in for truth, as though nobody has ever spoken clearly and lied.' b'But listening to Crow, the songwriter I kept thinking of was Chan Marshall, whose early music as Cat Power felt confessional but surreal, painfully direct but impossible to pin down. Like Marshall, Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s sleight of hand is that standing naked doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make him any easier to see. If anything, Crow\xe2\x80\x99s cold spaces and plainspoken delivery lull the listener into an illusion of solid ground even when it\xe2\x80\x99s not there, laying everything on the same emotional bandwidth, from meditations on geese and forest fires to descriptions of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s jaundiced skin. He never tells you how to feel, or more surprisingly, when.' b'Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s early albums as the Microphones captured the solipsism of one\xe2\x80\x99s 20s, where even small feelings are uncontainable, not the internal flicker of neurons but plate tectonics, the saga of raging rivers and moons and stars. Here, one\xe2\x80\x99s inner world was always swallowing the outer one, not just a life among many but an allegory of heaven and earth. That the music was so obsessively layered, so obviously the product of a single mind only cemented the underlying metaphor: Elverum wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the center of his universe, he was its creator.' b'Real life\xe2\x80\x94its unpunctuated hum, its customer-service lines\xe2\x80\x94has a way of knocking that out of you. Over the past several years, Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s point of view has become earthbound to the point of mundanity. Sauna, from 2015, featured an entire song about walking to the bookstore and seeing a pumpkin. Refreshingly, the pumpkin was not presented as a metaphor for anything; it was a pumpkin. Or, if it was a metaphor, it was only for the accumulation of stuff with no particular meaning or attachment to narrative, for that rare, seamless mindset where things are what they are. Crow\xe2\x80\x99s sharpest line is in its third act: \xe2\x80\x9cConceptual emptiness was cool to talk about, back before I knew my\xc2\xa0way around these hospitals.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Most of the time, though, Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s ground isn\xe2\x80\x99t so solid. Crow isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much about sickness or death but the hallucinatory stupor of grief, a state where everything\xe2\x80\x94toothbrushes, flies, crows, and sunsets\xe2\x80\x94flickers with suggestion and memory, as though Genevi\xc3\xa8ve\xe2\x80\x99s spirit had been scattered back into the universe like seeds. One understands Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s temptation intuitively: After all, he can still hold her toothbrush.' b'So simple, so tactile, so deceptively real are these songs. Their cumulative effect is that they become wobbly with metaphor, forcing the listener into the kind of magical thinking that transforms everything in the living world into a sign of the dead, only to snap back into a reality that for better and worse means nothing. Halfway through the album, Elverum\xe2\x80\x99s daughter asks if mama swims, to which Elverum replies that yes, she swims all the time now, because they scattered her ashes over water.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s most breathtaking line is its last. \xe2\x80\x9cSweet kid, I heard you murmur in your sleep. \xe2\x80\x98Crow,\xe2\x80\x99 you said. \xe2\x80\x98Crow.\xe2\x80\x99 And I asked, \xe2\x80\x98Are you dreaming about a crow?\xe2\x80\x99 And there she was.\xe2\x80\x9d In a single moment, the mechanics of these songs\xe2\x80\x94the way dreams refract life, the way grief resurrects the dead without logic or warning\xe2\x80\x94becomes blindingly clear. Then, either because Elverum is polite, or because he\xe2\x80\x99s tired, or because there is nothing more to say, he ends with the image of his wife lingering like something glimpsed through a rainy window, blurry, then gone.' b""It would be easy to hear this album as sad.\xc2\xa0Certainly the facts of Elverum's story are. But\xc2\xa0facts aren\xe2\x80\x99t art and art isn\xe2\x80\x99t real, at least not the way cancer is. For an album so firmly anchored by death,\xc2\xa0Crow\xc2\xa0is suffused with life: The geese, the forest fires, the crows, the grocery-store lines where Elverum stumbles through awkward conversation with people from town. Tragedy hasn't stopped him from noticing the world; if anything, it seems to have pried his eyes open for good. As for the question of sadness, I\xc2\xa0defer to a quote attributed to Anton Chekhov that art should \xe2\x80\x9cprepare us for tenderness.\xe2\x80\x9d I have two very young children of my own; one of them is sleeping on my chest while I write. Listening to\xc2\xa0Crow, I find myself imagining what life would be like if I had to raise them without their mother. Think along these lines for any longer than a few seconds and you, like I, may find yourself rebounding from sorrow to a state of almost infinite gratitude. Take a good look, Elverum says: Most of this is beautiful and none of it is guaranteed."""
b'Pallbearer',6.0,b'Heartless',0,b'Metal',b'March 24 2017',"b""The deep cauldron of metal, prog, and doom influences\xc2\xa0have so far been a key to Pallbearer's greatness, but their third record fails to piece it all together. They have run up against their limits.""","b'Rising metal stars Pallbearer have an unlikely fusion of influences: melancholic doom, prog that\xe2\x80\x99s more \xe2\x80\x9980s slick than \xe2\x80\x9970s technical, and a touch of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-produced hard rock. One couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have predicted they would go from cult metal festivals like Rites of Darkness to Bonnaroo in a few years. Pallbearer should be commended for making it this far with their sound, but Heartless, their third record, shows that they have run up against their limits.' b'Album opener \xe2\x80\x9cI Saw the End\xe2\x80\x9d is\xc2\xa0similar\xc2\xa0to Foundations of Burden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ghost I Used to Be,\xe2\x80\x9d Pallbearer\xe2\x80\x99s first realization that they could take their heavy sound and mold\xc2\xa0it into something catchy. Those often opposite attributes\xc2\xa0are sharpened and condensed, especially when guitarist Devin Holt rips into his solo at the end. They covered Type O Negative\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLove You to Death\xe2\x80\x9d on last year\xe2\x80\x99s Fear and Fury\xc2\xa0EP, and in \xe2\x80\x9cThe End\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99ve mastered Kenny Hickey\xe2\x80\x99s layered, warm goth-metal soloing. Combined with their Pallbearer\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0love of Pink Floyd, they\xe2\x80\x99ve reaffirmed prog\xe2\x80\x99s role into metal, especially Rush\xe2\x80\x99s cerebral rocking.' b'Heartless could use more of that inspiration. They\xe2\x80\x99ve become their own worst enemy by writing meandering tracks that betray their prog loftiness and their innate need to crush. \xe2\x80\x9cThorns\xe2\x80\x9d attempts to light the same fire as \xe2\x80\x9cThe End\xe2\x80\x9d and exhausts itself as it goes on. \xe2\x80\x9cLie of Survival\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDancing in Madness\xe2\x80\x9d are worse offenders, as both build towards nothing and use doom as a crutch, rather than as a starting point. In the past, weighty sorrow poured out; here, it\xe2\x80\x99s strained, slow for the sake of slow. Background synths don\xe2\x80\x99t add anything to these songs, and they also don\xe2\x80\x99t get across bassist Joseph Rowland\xe2\x80\x99s infatuation with krautrock. The beginning of \xe2\x80\x9cDancing\xe2\x80\x9d is ripe for more active electronics, some series of Tangerine Dream-like arpeggios, something to break up the monotony that was once so rich. Pallbearer are not shredders or speed demons; any slight dip in momentum is fatal, and those two tracks shoot Heartless down. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked against them before, as they were adapting doom into prog\xe2\x80\x99s confines, but this record doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move that concept\xc2\xa0forward.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cCruel Road\xe2\x80\x9d awakens Heartless from its stupor by taking a lumbering\xc2\xa0approach to theatrical metal. \xe2\x80\x9cRoad\xe2\x80\x9d moves like a King Diamond song\xc2\xa0in its succession: a brooding intro, rising hysterics, a dip into neoclassical melodies, then another climatic spike to close the song. Overt dramatics are something Pallbearer hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked with before, and it feels a lot fresher than most of the record.\xc2\xa0The common line between \xe2\x80\x9cI Saw the End\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCruel Road\xe2\x80\x9d is Pallbearer falter less when they break out from their gloomy template. \xe2\x80\x9cA Plea For Understanding\xe2\x80\x9d is the longest and most somber track on Heartless, and perhaps its best, with a lighter take on doom. Holt and Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s shimmering cleans really carry that mournful feeling \xe2\x80\x9cDancing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLie\xe2\x80\x9d struggle to convey, and Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s vocals have never soared higher. \xe2\x80\x9cA Plea\xe2\x80\x9d is such a chore to get to, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0too bad\xc2\xa0Heartless is more defined by its bookends.' b'I recently saw Pallbearer perform\xc2\xa0in Austin, and Rowland was brimming with energy, acting almost as a hype man, and Holt found a new ecstatic height in his soloing. They brought an arena liveliness to a sound that requires patience. \xe2\x80\x9cThe End\xe2\x80\x9d benefitted from this invigorated band, and there\xe2\x80\x99s good to reason to think it will become a staple of their sets. Bringing it live is still crucial to metal success, and on that front they are ready to ascend to the next level. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t translate on Heartless, where too much space is squandered.'"

That\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of an oversimplification, but the dichotomy between the two modes is still intact enough where it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say Fucked Up has operated as two different bands. For perspective, compare how 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Glass Boys\xc2\xa0featured Tragically Hip frontman Gord Downie, while 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Year of the Tiger featured Jim Jarmusch.' b'Like last year\xe2\x80\x99s two-track, 45-minute release, This Mother Forever, Year of the Snake sees Fucked Up venturing further out into realms of drone, ambient, and psychedelia with shades of prog and fusion thrown in for good measure. In fact, the two releases work as companion pieces and make the most sense as a pair. Both feature epic-length songs in the 15-to-30-minute range. But it\xe2\x80\x99s their differences that reveal the full breadth of Fucked Up\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions.' b'Where This Mother Forever sticks to a uniform structure of slow building\xe2\x80\x94its two songs are basically single ideas stretched about as far as they can go\xe2\x80\x94Year of the Snake flows in a less linear fashion, its ideas materializing and de-materializing as if the band could have turned them into separate songs but chose instead to let them bleed into one another.\xc2\xa0Over its 24-minute span, the title track encompasses simplistic riffing that verges on stoner metal, pastoral new-age psychedelia (complete with pan flute, recorder, and prayer bowl), epic hard rock, and a violin section that lands convincingly close to post-rock. Each section has ample time to simmer and it never feels like the band sacrifices flow for the sake of experimentation.' b'About halfway through the title track, when Fucked Up are going full bore channeling 2112-era Rush at their most majestic, the song transitions so that a synth figure bubbles up from underneath. The two parts initially clash, like someone bumping loud music in a car not far away. For that moment, Year of the Snake sounds almost like a mashup, but it\xe2\x80\x99s short-lived. It also exemplifies how carefully considered all of the decisions on Year of the Snake are.' b""On the other hand, nothing feels especially careful about the voice of Damian Abraham, whose\xc2\xa0bark sounds so large and forceful it's like listening to King Kong next to an orchestra. That\xc2\xa0contrast gives Year of the Snake its distinct character. And as Fucked Up have delved into ever more delicate forms of expression, it\xe2\x80\x99s been interesting to see how the band addresses the discrepancy between Abraham's style and the rest of the instrumentation. Abraham doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear on the second track, drummer Jonah Falco\xe2\x80\x99s six-minute instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cPassacaglia,\xe2\x80\x9d and guitarist Mike Haliechuk composed the title track in a way that employs Abraham as an intermittent texture rather than a focal point. Which isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t plenty of Abraham to go around, but only that if his voice was a dealbreaker for you before, Year of the Snake might be your best shot at appreciating everything that Fucked Up have to offer. (Guitarists Josh Zucker and Ben Cook do not appear on the EP.)"" b'At the beginning of \xe2\x80\x9cPassacaglia,\xe2\x80\x9d which functions as a kind of denouement for the title track, the guitars (played by Falco) contain echoes of\xc2\xa0Killing Joke\xe2\x80\x99s groundbreaking 1980 self-titled debut. As revolutionary as Killing Joke sounded at the time, they approached their music as if it was a given that punk\xe2\x80\x99s rules were there to be shattered.\xc2\xa0Likewise, even after decades\xe2\x80\x99 worth of relaxing boundaries, Fucked Up bastardize\xc2\xa0hardcore in a way that gives off the thrill of creative heresy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a creative insurgency waged from within its own ranks,\xc2\xa0Year of the Snake\xc2\xa0makes the genre sound more pliable than ever.'"
b'The Fun Years',8.1,b'Heroes of the Second Story Walk Up',0,b'Electronic',b'March 24 2017',b'The new album from the ambient baritone guitar and turntable duo is\xc2\xa0the most fully formed and expressive to date. Its recurring themes and phosphorescent textures evoke an engaging kind of ambiguity.',"b'Think of the Fun Years as Ratatat, only inverted. Like the feline-sampling Brooklyn bros, the bicoastal duo emerged a little more than a decade ago, offering the allure of an oddball instrumental configuration\xe2\x80\x94a baritone guitarist with a sharp melodic sensibility and a crucial producer with a knack for situating that sound in some deeply absorbing context. But where Ratatat favored samples and beats and athletic themes, the Fun Years instead sprawled, sculpting soundtracks for the gloaming and for daybreak, or music to be played between Ratatat\xe2\x80\x99s up-all-night anthems. Isaac Sparks used turntables to create haunted landscapes populated by soft drones, disembodied voices, and textural phantoms, overlaid by Ben Recht\xe2\x80\x99s circular guitar lines, which always suggested some deep, unspoken longing. The Fun Years were a salve for when the lights weren\xe2\x80\x99t quite out, but the party was inarguably over.' b'The engrossing new Heroes of the Second Story Walk-Up at long last perfects that premise and promise. It is the most fully formed and expressive of the Fun Years\xe2\x80\x99 ten albums to date and an immersive emotional Rorschach test, where each moment scans differently depending on what you bring to it. A forty-five-minute suite of seven interwoven pieces, Walk-Up moves like a long piano sonata, where each movement seems to comment on the same subject but never in quite the same way. The approach enables an emotional breadth and accessibility that can be rare in these arcane corners of instrumental music, making Walk-Up the kind of record you want to crawl into and inhabit for a spell.' b'During the second movement, for instance, the guitars chime as though marching toward some grand post-rock climax. Just beneath, though, there\xe2\x80\x99s a teeming bed of strained static and hiss, lurking in wait. The signals grow and eventually overtake those guitars, crawling across them and forcing them into submission, like ivy spreading over stone ruins. By the time Recht\xe2\x80\x99s guitar creeps through the electronics for the third movement, they\xe2\x80\x99re anxious and desperate, with tense minor notes reflecting prior failures. But they begin to harmonize with Sparks\xe2\x80\x99 choir of electronics, shaping a two-player symphony that somehow sounds hellish and heavenly at once. And are those deep bass drum clips pounding beneath part five\xe2\x80\x94aptly dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cDeepest Xylophone\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the sound of approaching thunder or a calming pulse? Walk-Up\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguity is its most rarified accomplishment, an instrument that lets you take your own temperature just by listening.' b'The Fun Years have been working at this admixture for years, devoted to the perfection of a singular sound and form. They\xe2\x80\x99re clear descendants of Touch Records and producer-composers such as guitarist Christian Fennesz and turntablist Philip Jeck, for whom timbre has sometimes seemed like the compositional pinnacle itself. But they\xe2\x80\x99ve learned over time to give these ethereal sounds structure and motion, so that listening to a series of drones and spirals feels more active than merely drifting. On Walk-Up, they unlock what has made Tim Hecker astonishingly popular in recent years\xe2\x80\x94textural phosphorescence that\xe2\x80\x99s occasionally overpowering and always open to interpretation.' b'As the needle or the cursor nears the end of Walk-Up, you may start to anticipate some rhapsodic finish, some radiant climax that pulls all the emotions of the first forty minutes into one honed point. That expectation is understandable, a vestige of the quintessential post-rock and soundtrack scripting that also inform the Fun Years. But Recht and Sparks avoid the temptation of tidiness, choosing instead to stay true to script and let these feelings fade into the middle distance as one. Recht militantly strums one sharp chord again and again, as Sparks\xe2\x80\x99 circuits run their course and empty into a series of fantastic glissandi that stretch, in the end, like an auditory ellipsis. It is a pragmatic conclusion, an honest admission that all these conflicting urges and experiences are only mercury, anyway. There is no triumph, no transcendence, no abject despair\xe2\x80\x94or, depending on your momentary outlook, a little bit of all of it.'"
b'Craig Finn',7.8,b'We All Want the Same Things',0,b'Rock',b'March 23 2017',"b""No longer sounding like stripped-down Hold Steady songs, Finn's latest solo album\xc2\xa0is the accomplished work of a wise songwriter\xe2\x80\x94mournful, musically layered, and full of empathy.""","b'Craig Finn has never written a song like \xe2\x80\x9cGod in Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d Sure, the plot points should be familiar to anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s followed his work since Lifter Puller or the Hold Steady. There\xe2\x80\x99s kissing in the streets; there\xe2\x80\x99s salvation in an unexpected place; there\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0drugs; there\xe2\x80\x99s a busted boombox playing Led Zeppelin III. But in \xe2\x80\x9cGod in Chicago,\xe2\x80\x9d the spoken-word piano ballad centerpiece of Finn\xe2\x80\x99s stunning new album, it feels heavier, like all his songs are contained in this one. Detailing a journey with a near stranger to settle the score for her dead brother, it illustrates the consequences of Finn\xe2\x80\x99s reckless, dangerous characters with a newfound penchant for realism. When the central drug deal goes down, it happens swiftly and silently. \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t the movies,\xe2\x80\x9d Finn explains\xe2\x80\x94a distinction that would have been moot in earlier songs, where real life and rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll clich\xc3\xa9 blended into bar-band euphoria.' b'Through much of his career, Finn\xe2\x80\x99s work has come with the coziness of a weekend spent returning to a college town: filled with old friends, inside jokes, and a bittersweet struggle to move forward. While the best moments of his previous two solo albums felt like little more than stripped-back versions of solid Hold Steady songs, We All Want the Same Things is more subtle and strange. Finn\xe2\x80\x99s weathered voice is at its most expressive, tied to songs that take him as far from his comfort zone as he\xe2\x80\x99s ever tread. It\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable record not for sounding like a return-to-form, but for feeling like entirely new territory without sacrificing its thrill or familiarity.' b'Finn\xe2\x80\x99s writing in these songs often feels like an exercise in empathy, seeking out people who\xe2\x80\x99ve never gotten the spotlight in his work. The male protagonist of \xe2\x80\x9cTangletown\xe2\x80\x9d is a wealthy divorcee who works a boring job, goes to bed early, and surrounds himself with luxuries that poorly mask his inner turmoil. You never learn his name, but it\xe2\x80\x99s almost certainly not \xe2\x80\x9cCharlemagne\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGideon\xe2\x80\x9d: it might be \xe2\x80\x9cCraig.\xe2\x80\x9d In \xe2\x80\x9cIt Hits When It Hits,\xe2\x80\x9d Finn sounds lonely and lost atop a slow-pulsing rhythm. \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell that today is gonna be a celebration,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeats while the music drags at his words, suggesting that today will, in fact, be just the opposite. His call for hard-won joy is miles away from Hold Steady anthems where celebration felt like a divine right: \xe2\x80\x9cThis summer, grant us all the power,\xe2\x80\x9d he once sang, \xe2\x80\x9cTo drink on top of water towers.\xe2\x80\x9d Here, his characters have a hard time summoning the power just to make it through the day.' b'Finn has referred to these new songs as \xe2\x80\x9cco-dependency jams,\xe2\x80\x9d and the relationships he describes in them are complex and colorful, from the partners-in-crime of \xe2\x80\x9cJester &\xc2\xa0June\xe2\x80\x9d to the grieving road-trippers of \xe2\x80\x9cGod in Chicago.\xe2\x80\x9d When people are called by name, he simply affirms their presence in the world, his characters grateful for not being alone. \xe2\x80\x9cJames, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you\xe2\x80\x99re here,\xe2\x80\x9d Finn sings through the synthy Kaputt-pop of \xe2\x80\x9cBirds Trapped in the Airport\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cNathan, you\xe2\x80\x99re my only friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he urges in \xe2\x80\x9cNinety Bucks.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course, the sincerity of any of these statements is tenuous. In \xe2\x80\x9cNinety Bucks,\xe2\x80\x9d Nathan responds to his friend by loaning her money, knowing she probably won\xe2\x80\x99t use it for MRI-certification. All the while, a single piano note plods in the background as their monotonous dynamic starts sounding something like stability. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I can push ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d Finn sings, \xe2\x80\x9cSome nights the wheels just spin.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The entirety of We All Want the Same Things is steeped in a mournful haze that makes the \xe2\x80\x9cwild kind of sadness\xe2\x80\x9d Finn sings about in \xe2\x80\x9cJester &\xc2\xa0June\xe2\x80\x9d come to life, and helps these songs transcend from short stories into action-packed anthems on par with his finest work. Bruce Springsteen, particularly his character-driven early work, has long been a reference point for Finn\xe2\x80\x99s music. But here, he seems more inspired by Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s darker material: the haunting fadeout of \xe2\x80\x9cRacing in the Street,\xe2\x80\x9d the layered vocals in \xe2\x80\x9cStolen Car,\xe2\x80\x9d the muted trumpet in \xe2\x80\x9cMeeting Across the River\xe2\x80\x9d that made its star-crossed drug deal sound doomed before it even happened. In \xe2\x80\x9cPreludes,\xe2\x80\x9d Finn sings about driving\xc2\xa0through a storm, accompanied by flutes that sound like snow against windshield wipers. In \xe2\x80\x9cRescue Blues,\xe2\x80\x9d Stuart Bogie\xe2\x80\x99s horn\xc2\xa0ascends as Finn comes closer to finding a sense of resolution. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess we all/Get by in different ways,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings tenderly, more confident with each repetition. Finally, Craig Finn sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, like he\xe2\x80\x99s got somewhere to go when the party\xe2\x80\x99s over.'"
b'Sorority Noise',8.0,"b""You're Not As _____ As You Think""",0,b'Rock',b'March 23 2017',"b'Sorority Noise know brutal honesty can be uncomfortable, but they employ it so well on their latest album, a rafter-reaching emo record about the raw stages of grief and loneliness.'","b'Numerous oft-quoted studies have equated a sleepless night with being legally drunk: you get the lowered inhibitions, impaired decision making, and depressed functionality, all without any of the buzz. And so Cameron Boucher\xe2\x80\x99s first lyric on Sorority Noise\xe2\x80\x99s third LP explains a lot of what\xe2\x80\x99s to come: \xe2\x80\x9cThis last week/I\xe2\x80\x99ve slept eight hours total.\xe2\x80\x9d From that point forward, You\xe2\x80\x99re Not As _____ As You Think tries to rouse itself from that despondency the best way Sorority Noise knows how: towering twin guitar leads, blinding bursts of distortion, instantly quotable lyrics where the vocals jump up an octave. It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of record that would be called \xe2\x80\x9ctriumphant\xe2\x80\x9d if Boucher was in a position to enjoy any of it.' b'The title of Sorority Noise\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 breakthrough Joy, Departed\xc2\xa0now carries unfortunate foreshadowing. In its wake, \xe2\x80\x9ca lot\xe2\x80\x9d of Boucher\xe2\x80\x99s friends took their own lives by way of heroin or suicide and they were memorialized on 2016\xe2\x80\x99s It Kindly Stopped for Me EP. Sounding like he\xe2\x80\x99d slept eight hours in the past six months, Boucher\xe2\x80\x99s register rarely left a conversational baritone, with offhand lyrics and monologues laid over incidental guitar and piano, almost avant-garde in its unguarded immediacy. Later that year, Boucher\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Sorority Noise outfit Old Gray reformed for the blood-chilling Slow Burn: its scalding, minute-long screamo outbursts were the polar opposite of It Kindly Stopped for Me, but it had the same white-knuckled edge to confronting death and addiction, too emotionally drained to be anything less than direct.' b""You\xe2\x80\x99re Not As opener \xe2\x80\x9cNo Halo\xe2\x80\x9d finds the exact midpoint between these two projects and points Sorority Noise in a bold new direction. Boucher has never been more in command of melody while in his lower register\xc2\xa0or while inhabiting his hardcore roots. But even as the band makes one last surge towards catharsis before collapsing in an exhausted heap, there\xe2\x80\x99s no relief: An organ drone fades out and the next song begins with Boucher muttering, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been feeling suicidal.\xe2\x80\x9d Similar to Modern Baseball and Julien Baker\xe2\x80\x94quoted in succession on \xe2\x80\x9cA Better Sun\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Sorority Noise\xe2\x80\x99s rise in stature has coincided with an increased candor about depression and advocacy for mental health treatment, confronting the sadboy caricature that still threatens to define this scene from the outside. The songs are in part Boucher's attempt to eliminate the distance between himself and the listeners and show they\xe2\x80\x99re all in this together."" b'Similar to Modern Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s Holy Ghost, You\xe2\x80\x99re Not As rushes headlong through the outside hype and internal strife, streamlining their sound rather than expanding upon it. Joy, Departed was rife with orchestral swells, florid poetry, and obtuse song titles\xe2\x80\x94the sort of things that pop-punk bands typically adopt to tell fans and the world at large know they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be taken seriously. But those didn\xe2\x80\x99t play to their strengths, and it was only in a live setting that Sorority Noise discovered their best selves: windmilling on Gibson Explorers, letting the crowd take over during the climactic lyrics of \xe2\x80\x9cUsing,\xe2\x80\x9d creating something close to group therapy.' b""The bulk of You\xe2\x80\x99re Not As is designed for that exact purpose. Boucher nicks lyrics from his friends on \xe2\x80\x9cA Better Sun\xe2\x80\x9d and flatly states, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the part where I did cocaine to impress every one of my mouth-breathing friends.\xe2\x80\x9d And then comes a goddamn pick slide. Out of context, it\xe2\x80\x99s a throwback to any number of post-Weezer ironists flooding the Buzz Bin, but it\xe2\x80\x99s borne of the introspection that reveals how abject misery can become as routine as an office job. A pick slide as a rote gesture. Meanwhile, the midsection of \xe2\x80\x9cDisappeared,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCar,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Are You?\xe2\x80\x9d eliminate any melody that wouldn't qualify as a hook. They rush as quickly as possible to the part that might give someone a sense of comfort in tragedy, or at least the understanding of what it might feel like to start losing friends in your early 20s. Boucher repeatedly chooses urgency over artifice: \xe2\x80\x9cYou say there\xe2\x80\x99s a god/You say you\xe2\x80\x99ve got proof/Well I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost friends to heroin/So what\xe2\x80\x99s your god trying to prove?\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a lyric he might\xe2\x80\x99ve been tempted to obscure or reword on Joy, Departed, and while the blunt immediacy of You\xe2\x80\x99re Not As can occasionally come off as awkward, the discomfort of honesty is easier to handle than forced poetry."" b'In the same way that Joy, Departed tried to remove both the stigma and seduction surrounding depression, death isn\xe2\x80\x99t glamorized in either direction here. All the\xc2\xa0albums about death from Sorority Noise\xe2\x80\x99s peer group (Sprained Ankle, Home, Like NoPlace Is There, Stage Four) tend to be\xc2\xa0really fucking serious. Sorority Noise have that capability; producer Mike Sapone\xe2\x80\x99s impact emerges during the slower numbers, as \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Letter From St. Sean\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLeave the Fan On\xe2\x80\x9d recreate the desolate spaces of Brand New\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cJesus\xe2\x80\x9d in miniature. The song structures become more compact, the concerns more corporeal.' b'You\xe2\x80\x99re Not As might be something closer to emo\xe2\x80\x99s Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the Night, a matter-of-fact, insomniac wake for those who died too young by their own hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got friends who\xe2\x80\x99ve died, but everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to be be alright,\xe2\x80\x9d Boucher sings on \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Are You?\xe2\x80\x9d and if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually believe it in the moment, the show must still go on. During another restless night in the van on \xe2\x80\x9cCar,\xe2\x80\x9d Boucher muses, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt more alive\xe2\x80\x9d and the glimmer of hope in those words feels earned. Hearing these lyrics yelled back at him as a show of solidarity might finally allow him to rest easy.'"
b'Porter Ray',6.6,b'Watercolor',0,b'Rap',b'March 23 2017',"b'On his Sub Pop debut, Seattle rapper Porter Ray unspools wordy verses that delve into personal tragedy, including his brother\xe2\x80\x99s murder.'","b'In 2009, Porter Ray Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Aaron, was shot and killed during an altercation he had no stake in; when the Seattle MC\xe2\x80\x99s son was born a few years later, he named him after his late sibling. Much of Watercolor, Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s airy, classicist debut, pivots between these two Aarons\xe2\x80\x94one a symbol of the graveyard\xe2\x80\x99s call, the other of the future\xe2\x80\x99s persistence.' b'Up until recently, the particulars of Sullivan\xe2\x80\x99s personal life have been asides in the exaggerated, smoke-session retellings of old conquests, as on the jazzy 2015 EP Nightfall. But here, for the first time, he takes the time to evaluate the tragedies that have touched his life\xe2\x80\x94in addition to his brother\xe2\x80\x99s killing, his father died of multiple sclerosis when Sullivan was 16, and the mother of his son recently died in a car crash. His stacks of wordy reflections can be deeply affecting, though they\xe2\x80\x99re also frequently muddled by ineffective execution. More often than not, Watercolor is colorless, a feeble rendering that obfuscates a harrowing coming-of-age tale with undercooked bruiser bars. Sullivan, who bubbled to the top of his city\xe2\x80\x99s talent pool by making the mundane seem luxurious with careful word choices and an eye for detail, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do his own unimaginable story justice.' b'To be fair, the album is tasked with doing a lot at once: putting on for an unheralded Seattle rap scene, earning the expectations that come with being an unusual signee for indie rock stalwart Sub Pop, and compressing nearly a decade of grief and introspection into a handful of tracks. Still, Sullivan often has trouble finding the right words, which can be disastrous for a rapper known for piecing sentence fragments together like a puzzle. He talks with his dad in his dreams and remembers blunted backyard bare-knuckle boxing with his brother on songs like \xe2\x80\x9cPast Life\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mirror Between Us,\xe2\x80\x9d but these stories get bogged down in moment-by-moment narration that lacks his signature ability to magnify and enhance.' b'When Sullivan locks in, he can be a force, effortlessly threading ideas. A song like \xe2\x80\x9cNavi Truck,\xe2\x80\x9d which uses cars as totems for cherished failed loves, showcases his best scene-setting. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Words\xe2\x80\x9d turns maternal advice into a new rapper checklist: be wary of drugs, envious friends, and poisonous relationships. It\xe2\x80\x99s fitting that the strongest moments come on \xe2\x80\x9cEast Seattle,\xe2\x80\x9d a song that relives his coldest nights on the city\xe2\x80\x99s streets, including the one when his brother was murdered. \xe2\x80\x9cJust try and visualize losin\xe2\x80\x99 your brother/Make you wonder how it feel inside/Hearing him suffer make me wonder how it feel to die/Seeing him sleeping in his coffin and he still inside,\xe2\x80\x9d he raps, remembering the 911 call he made from Aaron\xe2\x80\x99s phone. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most gut-wrenching moment on the album.' b'Unfortunately, Watercolor doesn\xe2\x80\x99t piece together enough of these moments. And while the productions are animated and spacious, creating openings for his jam-packed phrases, the sound doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take the full step forward that would help spotlight and redefine Seattle rap. For all its wrenching inspiration, Watercolor paints an incomplete portrait of the city and struggles that made Porter Ray one of its most vocal envoys.' b""Correction:\xc2\xa0After publication, a family member informed us that the mother of Sullivan's child had recently died in a car crash.

b'Lea Bertucci',7.0,b'All That Is Solid Melts Into Air',0,b'Experimental',b'March 23 2017',"b'The New York-based composer offers two experimental, evocative\xc2\xa0pieces featuring cello, viola, and double bass to uniquely recreate and interact with the spaces in which they were recorded.'","b'The two compositions on New York-based artist Lea Bertucci\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0All That Is Solid Melts Into Air\xc2\xa0are the product of the two spaces in which they were recorded: ISSUE\xc2\xa0Project Room\xe2\x80\x99s 22 Boerum Place\xc2\xa0theater in downtown Brooklyn, and the cavernous main room of the Knockdown Center in Maspeth, Queens (both cornerstones of New York\xe2\x80\x99s experimental music and performance communities). As an instrumentalist, Bertucci generally works with woodwinds, but here she composes and conducts for strings. These challenging, durational works tease a range of sounds and narratives out of these instruments, experimenting with how they resonate in the distinctive spaces in which they were recorded.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cCepheid Variations,\xe2\x80\x9d with Leila\xc2\xa0Bourdreuil\xc2\xa0on cello and Jeanann Dara on viola, was written for the 22 Boerum Street theater when Bertucci was a resident at Issue Project Room, premiering there in early 2015.It begins as a delicate conversation between cello and viola, conducted initially in sustained, crystalline harmonics. This picks up, occasionally, in miniature palpitations of rushed sound, until Bordreuil and Dara\xe2\x80\x99s instruments meet, ringing out. From there, a sort of dissolution occurs, the sound of bowed strings swallowed by scraping and whining. Bertucci enters the score with live tape manipulations, lending texture but also upending the sense of familiarity and solidity afforded by a richer-sounding and more recognizable string instrument. Her concrete sound moves in space quite differently from the strings, and the juxtaposition of the two instills an unsettling and thrilling sense of multidimensionality.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cDouble Bass Crossfade\xe2\x80\x9d is the more conceptual of the two pieces, relying not just on resonance in space, but on a pair of players\xe2\x80\x99 movement through it. To record, James Ilgenfritz and Sean Ali were positioned at opposite corners of Knockdown Center\xe2\x80\x99s massive main room, their double basses amplified wirelessly. For just over forty\xc2\xa0minutes, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, they moved in the space: first toward one another, crossing paths and then journeying on to the spot opposite from where they started. In a recorded version, of course, such movement is less immediately audible, though there\xe2\x80\x99s something charming about projecting an image of the two musicians traveling and interacting onto this relational performance.' b'They toy with scale, pulling tones from all over the bass\xe2\x80\x99s register, but particularly following the splintering harmonics of \xe2\x80\x9cCepheid,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDouble Bass Crossfade\xe2\x80\x9d maintains a physicality, a sense of weightedness. If the former resembles the auditory equivalent of a sharp graphite drawing, the latter brings to mind rough smears of oil. As the players approach one another, their instruments pick up volume\xc2\xa0and develop textures below their plaintive scrawls. The double basses begin to growl in\xe2\x80\x94well, not really in harmony, but as they hit their respective low ends, their rumbling melts together, producing a totalizing effect.' b'Though these pieces often build to moments of breathless intensity, they both unfold in a distinctly unhurried way. One gets the sense that Bertucci arrives at her work not with an idea to impose, but a question to develop. The groundlessness of the music isn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether surprising, and, as evidenced particularly well in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cepheid Variations,\xe2\x80\x9d can propel the listener somewhere new (a place that I\xe2\x80\x99m not convinced even Bertucci could, or would want to, put language to). It was strange to be considering site-specificity while listening to these works in no particular place. What does it mean for a recording to hold traces of a location when those traces are largely immaterial? I think, at least, of the fact of venues so willing to be transformed through the introduction of chaotic harmonics and strange resonances, of Bertucci being afforded space to fill and warp.'"
b'Drake',7.8,b'More Life',0,b'Rap',b'March 22 2017',"b""Drake's course correction to\xc2\xa0VIEWS bursts with energy\xe2\x80\x94more South African house, more grime, more Kanye. It's a long player made for luxuriating and a total immersion into Drake's world-pop lifestyle.""","b'Drake\xe2\x80\x99s VIEWS\xc2\xa0was a commercial pinnacle and a creative and personal dead end. He scored the biggest hit of his career with \xe2\x80\x9cOne Dance,\xe2\x80\x9d but the album surrounding it was so aggrieved and solipsistic you felt like you were insulting Drake by listening to it. His telepathic bond with producer Noah \xe2\x80\x9c40\xe2\x80\x9d Shebib had turned stale and over its punishing 80-plus minutes he wrung every last drop of sour grapes from his Beta-Male Conqueror persona. He had crushed his frenemies, seen them driven before him, and heard the lamentations of their women\xe2\x80\x94or at least purposefully ignored their texts. What was next but exile?' b'He seems to be tacitly admitting to this stagnation throughout the warm, pulsing, and generous More Life. His solution is a \xe2\x80\x9cPlaylist\xe2\x80\x9d (not a big old serious Album, the implication goes, nor one of those little \xe2\x80\x9cmixtapes\xe2\x80\x9d other rappers bother with) that forces Drake out into the sunlight again, where he can once again mingle with the people. On More Life\xe2\x80\x99s closing track \xe2\x80\x9cDo Not Disturb,\xe2\x80\x9d he acknowledges the bleak spot he was in: \xe2\x80\x9cI was an angry youth\xc2\xa0while I was writing VIEWS/Saw a side of myself that I just never knew.\xe2\x80\x9d He even lets his mother\xc2\xa0pipe in with a voice message two-thirds of the way through the record on \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t Have Everything\xe2\x80\x9d as she admonishes her son for the hostile, suspicious streak he was nurturing. \xe2\x80\x9cThat attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to feel alienated,\xe2\x80\x9d she advises.' b'He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly drop the attitude, but he does play the background on More Life, implicitly acknowledging that he is often the least appealing element of his massively successful art. Dialing back on his self-pity allows all his skills that have kept him on top to float back to the surface: his ear for melodies, his sophisticated tastes, his curation skills. The more voices he lets into the frame, the fuller and richer the results, and More Life bursts with energy and lush sounds\xe2\x80\x94more guests, more genres, more producers, more life. It is as confident, relaxed, and appealing as he\xe2\x80\x99s sounded in a couple of years.' b'Drake steps back and lets the dusky-voiced 19-year-old British singer Jorja Smith soar over a sinuous club track from the rising South African house producer Black Coffee on the gorgeous \xe2\x80\x9cGet It Together.\xe2\x80\x9d Black Coffee and Jorja comprise at least 80 percent of the song; Drake is mostly relegated to mumbling or doubling the hook. Sampha bleeds his gorgeous hurt over the entirety of \xe2\x80\x9c4422,\xe2\x80\x9d with no one else in sight, and Skepta claims an entire track, boasting that he \xe2\x80\x9cdied and came back as Fela Kuti.\xe2\x80\x9d Young Thug steals not one but two songs, spitting a dense verse with no vocal filter on \xe2\x80\x9cSacrifices\xe2\x80\x9d and yelping along with the roots-reggae horns of \xe2\x80\x9cIce Melts.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Throughout, Drake\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for the music of other cultures remains ravenous. \xe2\x80\x9cI switch flow like I switch time zone,\xe2\x80\x9d he raps on \xe2\x80\x9cGyalchester,\xe2\x80\x9d the song title itself a patois nickname for the neighborhood of Manchester. On \xe2\x80\x9cSacrifices,\xe2\x80\x9d he boasts \xe2\x80\x9cI got Dubai plates in the California state.\xe2\x80\x9d In both reach and sound, Drake may now be one of the most global pop stars in history. He is shrewd and relentless about his globe-trotting on More Life: \xe2\x80\x9cDis a habibis ting, yeah?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks on the intro to a track called \xe2\x80\x9cPortland,\xe2\x80\x9d invoking a vivid zone of confusion where Arabic and Caribbean slang collides with Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s own Quavo somewhere in the rainy Pacific Northwest.' b'As always, there are moments when it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what Drake thinks he is borrowing. He tackles \xe2\x80\x9cNo Long Talk\xe2\x80\x9d in an unsteady tough-guy patois\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthings\xe2\x80\x9d turns to \xe2\x80\x9ctings\xe2\x80\x9d but then sneaks back into \xe2\x80\x9cthings\xe2\x80\x9d when he\xe2\x80\x99s not watching it, so he sounds a bit more like a kid with a hairbrush in the mirror than he probably intends. He also proudly shouts out his bodyguard Baka Not Nice, a man who faced human trafficking charges and was imprisoned on domestic assault charges (Drake boasts that Baka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cquick to let a motherfuckin\xe2\x80\x99 TEC slam\xe2\x80\x9d). It\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of his unsavory tendency to borrow street credibility from figures like Baka who have paid the price for it, the same impulse that had him pointing to a \xe2\x80\x9cprison visit\xe2\x80\x9d on his song \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Birds, One Stone\xe2\x80\x9d as evidence that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t some \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged kid.\xe2\x80\x9d Who stunts about visiting a prison?' b'As one of the first rap superstars forged entirely outside the crucible of the American drug war, Drake has always had a confused relationship to the \xe2\x80\x9crules\xe2\x80\x9d of hip-hop. This makes his moments of flexing interesting\xc2\xa0if only for the friction they generate between the role he\xe2\x80\x99s assuming and the figure he cuts. He opens More Life with \xe2\x80\x9cFree Smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d a hard-charging and take-no-prisoners track, the sort of moment on a rap album where you ruthlessly cut down challengers and re-establish your dominance. But he spends it remembering how he used to eat Applebee\xe2\x80\x99s and Outback, or the time he drunk-texted J. Lo (\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an old number so it bounced back\xe2\x80\x9d). He does address his disgraced foe Meek Mill, who fell on a sword trying to expose Drake as a fraud: ""How you let the kid fighting ghostwriting rumors turn you to a ghost?\xe2\x80\x9d he taunts. This is a peculiarly self-skewering line of attack, a bit like punching yourself in the face before going for your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s gut. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly elicit the classic, crowd-of-bystanders \xe2\x80\x9cooooh!\xe2\x80\x9d that direct shots are supposed to incite; more of a \xe2\x80\x9cuh...hmmm.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'This pluralistic and self-contradicting identity has always been part and parcel of Drake\xe2\x80\x99s inheritance to hip-hop; it will be a large part of his legacy. Name a pop star who has ever had a clearer picture of their place in the culture, who senses exactly what they can get away with and what they can\xe2\x80\x99t (other than Taylor Swift). He knows himself and his worth, at least as a market entity. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know they gotta be faster than me to get to me, no one\xe2\x80\x99s done it successfully,\xe2\x80\x9d he boasts, truthfully, on \xe2\x80\x9cDo Not Disturb.\xe2\x80\x9d More than anything,* More Life* plays like a just-in-time course correction to the excesses of VIEWS, a remarkable feat of troubleshooting that assures that October\xe2\x80\x99s Very Own\xe2\x80\x94whose catalog passed 10 billion Spotify streams before this release\xe2\x80\x94continues to own several Octobers henceforth.' b'More Life is long, for sure. It is, of course,\xc2\xa0designed to be long, to swallow up all of your streaming bandwidth. Twenty-two songs all but asks you forget other rappers and musicians exist for a while. This is the new power play in an age of digital infinitude. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer insight in return, really\xe2\x80\x94eight years into examining the wages of his success, he\xe2\x80\x99s still stumbling on thoughts like, \xe2\x80\x9cHow you run out of gas on the road to riches?\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cWinning is problematic\xe2\x80\x9d as if they are actual epiphanies. But he does offer immersion. When everything is just right\xe2\x80\x94the mood, the lighting, the production, the melody\xe2\x80\x94that immersion feels total, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine wanting to be anywhere else. The gorgeous \xe2\x80\x9cSince Way Back\xe2\x80\x9d stretches the beat way out, the silences in between yawning wide open so you momentarily lose all sense of time and momentum. It stops the album dead in the best way possible. This is the Drake moment, when you exist inside the bubble of a single drunken thought, where all priorities bend like light through a water glass and you find yourself hanging on your phone, watching the twinkling ellipsis of a responding text message like it\xe2\x80\x99s the answer to all of your prayers.'"
b'Talaboman',7.6,b'The Night Land',0,b'Electronic',b'March 22 2017',b'Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s John Talabot and Stockholm\xe2\x80\x99s Axel Boman work in tandem to bring house music off the floor and into the air with an invigorating and meditative mix of compositions.',"b'Making electronic music is often a solitary endeavor, and sometimes, after enough lonely all-nighters in the studio, its practitioners find themselves craving company. The annals of electronica are peppered with what we might call \xe2\x80\x9csuperduos,\xe2\x80\x9d pairings where both members first made their names as solo artists. Sometimes these are one-offs, like Mike & Rich (the early-\xe2\x80\x9990s collaboration between \xc2\xb5-Ziq and Aphex Twin) and Supermayer (Superpitcher and Michael Mayer). Sometimes, the new projects become so influential that they threaten to eclipse their members\xe2\x80\x99 solo careers, as briefly happened with TNGHT (Hudson Mohawke and Lunice). Sometimes, these outings give their members an opportunity to veer outside their usual lanes, like househeads Motor City Drum Ensemble and Marcus Worgull dabbling in *kosmische *music as Vermont. More often, they find their participants doubling down on shared traits, like Mumdance and Logos collectively engineering an ultra-reduced, hyper-abstracted form of grime, or Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock cutting all the meat off techno\xe2\x80\x99s bones.' b'Talaboman are Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s John Talabot and Stockholm\xe2\x80\x99s Axel Boman, and the goofy portmanteau is strangely fitting. The crosshatched part of the Venn diagram connecting the two artists is actually relatively slim. Both musicians make a kind of house music, both are disco fans, and both are given to bright-eyed reveries (compare Talabot\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDestiny\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cSo Will Be Now\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d with Boman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c1979\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Dust of This Planet\xe2\x80\x9d). But that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. If the tattooed Boman sometimes comes across as the wily class clown, Talabot is the sensitive kid in the corner, distracted by his colors and his books. Together, though, something interesting happens. Their collective output doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound much like either\xe2\x80\x99s work; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even necessarily reflect the thin, convex sliver where their interests overlap. Instead, they\xe2\x80\x99ve hit upon something new.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s long, slowly evolving tracks tend to be more mood pieces than club jams, defined less by their beats than by the rounded contours of their synthesizer patches. Album opener \xe2\x80\x9cMidnattssol\xe2\x80\x9d (Swedish for \xe2\x80\x9cMidnight Sun\xe2\x80\x9d) is a scrap of Balearic cosmic disco replete with rain sticks and birdcalls, and it sets a tone midway between ritual and celebration, private contemplation and collective abandon. Half the set hovers around that languid pace. \xe2\x80\x9cSafe Changes,\xe2\x80\x9d an emotional highlight, toys with a Kraftwerkian melody and bubbling dub delay over a measured andante drumbeat; \xe2\x80\x9cSix Million Ways,\xe2\x80\x9d a hair faster, teases a slinky arpeggio out of a murky, slow-motion house groove. The album\xe2\x80\x99s other highlight is \xe2\x80\x9cBrutal Chugga-Chugga.\xe2\x80\x9d As a pitter-pat CR-78 rhythm percolates beneath the keys, their synths gradually stiffen and sharpen; the Knife\xe2\x80\x99s Silent Shout*\xc2\xa0*briefly comes to mind, and the sound of thunder occasionally peals across the background.' b'The musicians have said that embarking upon the project gave them license to buy scads of hardware; fortunately, unlike most kids with new toys, a remarkable air of restraint prevails. All that extra room paves the way for some wild acousmatic effects: Listening through decent headphones, the steady backbeat thump of \xe2\x80\x9cDins El Llit\xe2\x80\x9d (Catalan for \xe2\x80\x9cIn Bed\xe2\x80\x9d) sounds for all the world like it\xe2\x80\x99s situated somewhere in the physical world, just outside the room you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in. It\xe2\x80\x99s disorienting and damn near magical.' b""The other half of the album kicks along closer to house music\xe2\x80\x99s usual pulse. \xe2\x80\x9cSamsa\xe2\x80\x9d is the album\xe2\x80\x99s clubbiest selection, and\xe2\x80\x94perhaps not coincidentally\xe2\x80\x94its least compelling, flogging dubby organ chords and bass squelch over tambourine backbeats for nearly 11 minutes. Along the way, they flirt with a tremolo synth lead that's strikingly reminiscent of Carl Craig\xe2\x80\x99s classic \xe2\x80\x9cFalling Up\xe2\x80\x9d remix, and while the extended climax might help explain why they stretch out the way they do, they could have managed just as much drama in half the time. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ghosts Hood\xe2\x80\x9d is more successful, wrapping a cowbell-heavy groove in burbling electronics and periodically unleashing quiet but expressive bursts of reverb. It's small tweaks like these, which subtly but decisively move the energy forward, that reveal the deftness of their touch. On \xe2\x80\x9cLoser\xe2\x80\x99s Hymn\xe2\x80\x9d and the closing \xe2\x80\x9cDins El Llit,\xe2\x80\x9d they keep the pace brisk but downplay the drums, and the results, a kind of dance music with its head in the clouds, are both invigorating and meditative\xe2\x80\x94like the album itself."""

Earth, meanwhile, is a Washington state doom band that trudges with an ambient, codeine-hazed pace. In other words, this electronic collaboration,\xc2\xa0Concrete Desert,\xc2\xa0is one\xc2\xa0man\xe2\x80\x99s looming sonic claustrophobia versus another\xe2\x80\x99s sprawling open space.' b'But dig into the nuances of their catalogs\xe2\x80\x94like the sparse first-half of the Bug\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 album Angels & Devils, or the low-end of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s heatstruck churn on that year\xe2\x80\x99s Primitive and Deadly\xe2\x80\x94and it begins to make sense.\xc2\xa0Forget genre or even structure: Martin and Carlson value pressure.\xc2\xa0They revel in the attack and release of slow-building drone grooves and the contrast between thumping bass and a floating tempo.\xc2\xa0*Concrete Desert *sees them finding common ground, though\xc2\xa0there\xe2\x80\x99s more debt to minimal, tense electronic music than dust-bleached rock.

The album feels crucially airy\xe2\x80\x94not breezy, but rather a stinging dry heat.\xc2\xa0A few songs let booming basslines take on\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0role of Carlson\xe2\x80\x99s droning riffs, or echo them, like the tense \xe2\x80\x9cSnakes Vs Rats.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Given room to wander, the feedback and reverb become instruments themselves.

On a track like \xe2\x80\x9cAgoraphobia,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0the lowrider subs are laced with guitar echo, and it feels less like a meeting of bass music and drone and more like bass music *as *drone.' b""If the album\xe2\x80\x99s title weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough, Martin has stated that *Concrete Desert *is a specifically Los Angeles kind of album, and not just because\xc2\xa0it was recorded there, in Daddy Kev\xe2\x80\x99s studio with DJ Nobody at the console.

b'Giusto Pio',8.2,b'Motore Immobile',0,b'Experimental',b'March 22 2017',"b'What is the difference between American and Italian\xc2\xa0minimalism? A preeminent example of the latter is this 1979 record, one of the most sumptuous, spiritual ambient albums of any era or provenance.'","b'Italian progressive rock icon and all-around renaissance man Franco Battiato once sought out violinist Giusto Pio for violin lessons. A member of Orchestra Sinfonica Di Milano Della RAI, Pio assisted Battiato as his sound was undergoing a furious metamorphosis, from the prog rock of his earliest albums to a more minimalist sound of the late \xe2\x80\x9970s (in this regard, Battiato is Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Brian Eno). Soon after, the duo would pivot towards pop song, with some of Battiato\xe2\x80\x99s early \xe2\x80\x9980s albums selling over a million copies, which led to the two collaborating on a Eurovision hit by 1984.' b""In 1979, the same year Battiato made L'Era Del Cinghiale Bianco (with Pio handling arrangements), Battiato also produced Pio\xe2\x80\x99s first solo album, Motore Immobile, two diametrically opposed efforts that showcased the duo\xe2\x80\x99s musical range. And while the former marked the tandem\xe2\x80\x99s first foray into pop, the latter stands as one of the towering beacons of Italian minimalism and one of the most sumptuous ambient albums of any era. Recently, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a greater appreciation for that era in Italian music\xc2\xa0with the Milanese label Die Schachtel reissuing stark classics like Luciano Cilio\xe2\x80\x99s Dell\xe2\x80\x99Universo Assente\xc2\xa0and Raul Lovisonni and Franceso Messina\xe2\x80\x99s Prati baganati del Monte Analogo. But Pio\xe2\x80\x99s debut has long been unobtainable. Originally released on the revered Cramps Records label (home to operatic progressives like Area and Demetrio Stratos as well as albums by American composers like John Cage and Robert Ashley), Motore Immobile has been near impossible to track down since its release. And with Pio\xe2\x80\x99s recent passing earlier this year, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fitting tribute to the man to have his greatest work see reissue now courtesy of the newcomer Soave label."" b'Motore Immobile is one of Italian minimalism\xe2\x80\x99s most beatific iterations, with an approach that brings to mind Italian cuisine, meaning a concentration on a handful of quality ingredients so as to reveal the profundities contained within such simple material. Though with food it\xe2\x80\x99s to reveal the essence of the earth; with this music, it\xe2\x80\x99s to experience something more celestial. The first side of the album features the seventeen-minute title track, wherein Pio explores the sonorities to be had in two church organs, a hum originating from the soft palette of vocalist Martin Kleist, and Pio\xe2\x80\x99s own violin. A burst of organ opens \xe2\x80\x9cMotore Immobile\xe2\x80\x9d as if the start of a Sunday service, though it soon seems as if the keys are stuck, holding the note well past the breaking point. Ever so carefully, the keys of that chord peel off and the hum of a voice in harmony can be heard alongside that drone. A minute in, Pio\xe2\x80\x99s violin ever so gently sneaks in alongside the two organs.' b'It is then that the piece appears to reach a standstill. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much in the way of an \xe2\x80\x9cevent,\xe2\x80\x9d but that\xe2\x80\x99s beside the point. The held keys of the organs resemble the op-art of Bridget Riley, the drones producing an aural moir\xc3\xa9. Pio\xe2\x80\x99s patience is remarkable throughout, letting the horsehair of his bow move exquisitely slow across the strings, ever so subtly keying a shift in the drones. And so subtle and subliminal are the exhalations of Kleist that if you listen on headphones, you might wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99re actually humming along with these held tones. When the organs again revert back to their opening chord, it gives the impression that \xe2\x80\x9cMotore Immobile\xe2\x80\x9d could just as easily continue on into infinity.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnanta\xe2\x80\x9d which comprises the second side, again uses a similar approach to suspended tones, this time with just piano and organ. With just the sparest of ingredients, Pio makes something delectable. A glissade of piano notes opens the piece before again settling into the sustained drone of the organ. The piano then carefully moves one note at a time against that continuum, to the point of where the piece seems to reach a stasis, only to have the piano break that stillness with a flurry of notes. And with every new cascade, the organ\xe2\x80\x99s drone shifts its center ever so slightly. But again, the piece\xe2\x80\x99s greatest attribute is that it again gives the illusion of suspending the passage of time.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put a finger one just what distinguishes Italian minimalism from its American counterparts, but to my ears, it ultimately boils down to lineage. While Americans trace back to the rugged and mischievous works of La Monte Young and Tony Conrad, the Italians go back to the compositions of Giacinto Scelsi, whose microtonal sound edges toward the mystic. As a result, Italian minimalism tends to be more crystalline and ascetic (read: pure) than what can be found elsewhere. It\xe2\x80\x99s telling that Pio grounds both of these extended compositions not in his violin work, but in the tones of the church organ. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sound that still resonates during services throughout the duomos of Italy, and one on Pio\xe2\x80\x99s Motore Immobile\xc2\xa0that too evokes a sense of the divine.'"
b'Real Estate',7.2,b'In Mind',0,b'Rock',b'March 21 2017',"b""Martin Courtney's songwriting adjusts to a revamped band lineup, while together they continue to perfect the singular, warm, and reliable Real Estate sound.""","b'When Real Estate named their last album Atlas, it was likely done both in earnest and irony. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a subtle landscape where I come from,\xe2\x80\x9d sang Martin Courtney, as he traced the anxieties contained within the sidewalks, horizons, clocks, and shadows of his suburban hometown. The New Jersey band captured the way that a few square miles can feel like the whole world, but also intensify feelings of isolation. Their softly woven guitars had never sounded more wistful, the perfect accompaniment to Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s ruminations of the divide between post-adolescent uncertainty and watching his life codify into an adulthood that millennials like him were never meant to achieve. He was so overawed by the sight of his wife next to him, and fearful of time slipping away, that you half-worried about how his temperate constitution would handle any truly earth-shattering change.' b'As it happened, Real Estate experienced something like that when founding guitarist Matt Mondanile left to pursue his Ducktails project. The split was seemingly acrimonious, though the details seemed less relevant than the matter of what it would do to their sound. Mondanile\xe2\x80\x99s spacey style gave Real Estate\xe2\x80\x99s compact universe a layer of fantasy\xc2\xa0and teased out the sweetness in Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s flat tones. They replaced him with Julian Lynch, re-enlisted\xc2\xa0Matt Kallman on keys, and went off to L.A. to record. For a reliable band like Real Estate, these are dramatic transformations. But In Mind, the outcome of this revamp, picks up pretty much where they left off, Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s guitar and Alex Bleeker\xe2\x80\x99s bass swishing like windshield wipers around Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s suburban koans.' b'Throughout In Mind, Courtney explores his sensitive relationship to his surroundings. \xe2\x80\x9cThe laughing brook that ran right through this town/Slowed to a smile when the mercury went down,\xe2\x80\x9d he coos on \xe2\x80\x9cStained Glass.\xe2\x80\x9d Plotting the progress from Atlas to the familiar and comforting In Mind is a similarly nuanced process. In the past, Real Estate\xe2\x80\x99s sound hung like a sweet, gormless open mouth, but Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s tougher guitar tone is a little more hard-bitten and yowling. He and Kallman team up on the intro to \xe2\x80\x9cStained Glass,\xe2\x80\x9d knitting a baroque cascade that owes some to the Byrds\xe2\x80\x99 energized arpeggiations. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Arrows\xe2\x80\x9d starts as a drowsy plod, the effects on Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s voice mimicking the slippery space between sleep and consciousness, but then sidles into a respectful jam, one guitar pinging high, the other disintegrating with each careening phrase. Just as fuzz and hysteria threaten\xc2\xa0to overtake the whole thing, it ends abruptly in a rare moment of humor (and a neat Beatles tribute).' b'If you like Real Estate best when they\xe2\x80\x99re trading in smaller gestures, these moves may seem treacherous, but by and large they crackle with electricity. The frame is fuller here, harking back to the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s production of bands like Teenage Fanclub, Jellyfish, and on the dreamy bossa nova fizz of \xe2\x80\x9cTime,\xe2\x80\x9d the High Llamas. This newfound density gives In Mind\xc2\xa0a claustrophobic atmosphere that mirrors Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s myopic state of mind. Since Atlas, he\xe2\x80\x99s become a father of two, working from home in Beacon, NY. Any self-employed person will recognize his queasy familiarity with his surroundings: the subtle changes that occur as dusk sets in, the comings and goings of local wildlife, the disorientating similarity of different sounds. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it the rain/Or a southbound train/That woke me up last night?\xe2\x80\x9d he wonders amid the starry swoop of the\xc2\xa0unfortunately titled \xe2\x80\x9cHolding Pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d At once reassuring and stifling, these details give a better sense of Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety than his more literal lyrics on the subject.' b'Of course, one person\xe2\x80\x99s quiet profundity is another\xe2\x80\x99s cruise control. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat this is/Is not real life/At least it isn\xe2\x80\x99t boring,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings on\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cHolding Pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d For Courtney, his well of lyrics about wistful cul-de-sac malaise never seems to dry up, though the subject starts to grow tired across the record. Likewise, when they wander from the beaten path they end up with \xe2\x80\x9cDiamond Eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d an Alex Bleeker song and\xc2\xa0In Mind\xe2\x80\x99s only total misfire. In the vein of a Pete Seeger fable, or the Grateful Dead writing Sunday school jams, it\xe2\x80\x99s so far outside their suburban comfort zone that it sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99ve been brainwashed by a benevolent cult. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a time to be humble/It\xe2\x80\x99s a time to be free/It\xe2\x80\x99s a time to raise our voices loud and not go quietly,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Bleeker\xc2\xa0sings, like Mr. Rosso on \xe2\x80\x9cFreaks and Geeks\xe2\x80\x9d trying to inspire his burnout students to protest peacefully.' b""In stark contrast, Real Estate's limitations become their greatest strengths. \xe2\x80\x9cServe the Song\xe2\x80\x9d is a warped, wandering introvert\xe2\x80\x99s lament. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chorus only interrupts/I sing to serve the song,\xe2\x80\x9d Courtney sings, in a sort of peaceful Quaker hymnal and insight into the band\xe2\x80\x99s MO. His touching, quiet shock at the disparity between his past and present hasn\xe2\x80\x99t dimmed, as the family man looks back at the slacker and feels an imperceptible connection. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot recall/Where I was at all/But I know what I heard/When I wrote those words/Green river still runs/Under that same sun/I never saw the source/But I know the course,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings on \xe2\x80\x9cSame Sun,\xe2\x80\x9d as impish, quizzical guitar chimes play up his bemusement."" b'Real Estate seemingly have no greater ambition than to perfect this one thing they do so well. While they live firmly in the middle of the road, they\xe2\x80\x99re also dramatic outliers: neither explicit nor artful, two modes innovated by indie-rock when it had started to seem less relevant than ever. Unlike the effortless Atlas, In Mind exposes a trace of tension between form and content. For all Courtney\xe2\x80\x99s synchronicity with his home environment, he sometimes sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s spinning his wheels rather than exploring the new contours of the recalibrated band.' b'' b'Correction: An earlier version of this review attributed the song \xe2\x80\x9cDiamond Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d to Martin Courtney.'"
b'Laetitia Sadier Source Ensemble',6.8,b'Find Me Finding You',0,b'Experimental',b'March 21 2017',"b'Like her former band Stereolab,\xc2\xa0Laetitia Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s new\xc2\xa0solo album draws on sounds ranging from French y\xc3\xa9-y\xc3\xa9 to krautrock, though its tone is earthier. It features a duet with Hot Chip\xe2\x80\x99s Alexis Taylor.'","b'In an interview\xc2\xa0surrounding her 2014 album Something Shines, former Stereolab singer Laetitia Sadier laughingly said\xc2\xa0that, since the days of her old group, she\xe2\x80\x99s been \xe2\x80\x9ccultivating the same piece of land, [but] maybe I grow different vegetables.\xe2\x80\x9d The pithy comment stands as a fairly perfect summation of the 48-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s career. Since arriving on the European indie scene back in 1991 with the first Stereolab EP,\xc2\xa0Super 45, Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s vocal and lyrical approach has remained consistent: She\xc2\xa0applies her crystalline alto to lyrics that explore philosophy and political inequality through a Marxist lens. In Stereolab and as a solo artist, Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s musical tastes have tended\xc2\xa0to skew nostalgic, mixing influences of 1960s pop from the U.S. and Brazil, easy listening, and German kosmische.' b'Find Me Finding You, the first album she\xe2\x80\x99s released as Laetitia Sadier Source Ensemble, also relies on these familiar musical elements. French drummer Emmanuel Mario and Brazilian bassist Xavi Munoz, both of whom played on Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s previous solo albums, are present throughout, as is David Thayer, the filmmaker and musician who co-ran the group Little Tornados with Sadier. Opener\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUndying Love for Humanity\xe2\x80\x9d burbles with intertwining guitar lines, stuttering keyboard signatures, and bouncing vocal harmonies\xe2\x80\x94it recalls French y\xc3\xa9-y\xc3\xa9 45s and the knotty exotica of the Free Design. The rest of the album is dotted lightly with krautrock droning, Latin percussion, and chiming twee.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cUndying Love\xe2\x80\x9d is ultimately an outlier, though, playing with\xc2\xa0those elements that Sadier is\xc2\xa0most associated with before the album moves towards\xc2\xa0earthy tones and a temperate atmosphere.\xc2\xa0Find Me\xc2\xa0maintains a consistent mood better than any other album Sadier has released on her own or with the now-defunct side-project Monade.\xc2\xa0There are minor pulse-quickening moments, like the psych pop interludes within \xe2\x80\x9cPsychology Active (Finding You),\xe2\x80\x9d but everything else sticks to a calm mid-tempo like a resting heart-rate.' b'Still, there\xe2\x80\x99s a wealth of variation to enjoy here.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Woman With the Invisible Necklace\xe2\x80\x9d somehow connects flamenco rhythms with a post-punk swing\xc2\xa0akin to the Marine Girls. Closer \xe2\x80\x9cSacred Project\xe2\x80\x9d shows off the keyboard collection of Ensemble member Phil F MU, with the rumble of Taurus 3 bass pedals warmly humming below a tinny modular melody and assorted synth squeaks.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cReflectors\xe2\x80\x9d builds confidently around a pulsing marimba and a rich bass tone before temporarily falling hushed, as\xc2\xa0guitar and flute waft around Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s commentary. \xe2\x80\x9cWars cannot overcome our troubles,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, \xe2\x80\x9cStatus, prestige, prominence, don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a thing at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d Though\xc2\xa0Find Me\xc2\xa0was written\xc2\xa0before the Brexit vote and the U.S.\xc2\xa0political disaster, Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0sharp eye for the slowly rolling tides of geopolitics gives these songs\xc2\xa0added resonance.' b'Sadier\xe2\x80\x99s lyrical\xc2\xa0pattern continues on Find Me, as her lines\xc2\xa0revolve around\xc2\xa0tyrants, indoctrination, and states of conflict. This is what makes \xe2\x80\x9cLove Captive\xe2\x80\x9d stand out. A\xc2\xa0duet with Hot Chip\xe2\x80\x99s Alexis Taylor, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0a ballad for slow dances, but it finds both\xc2\xa0singers shunning the idea of romantic love, wondering why we \xe2\x80\x9cmake promises of eternity/When really a heart needs to run open and free.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, they advocate for a broader definition: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are made to love/Not to fall in love.\xe2\x80\x9d The song comes early in the album, but it\xc2\xa0provides a small lyrical breather that feels necessary to the whole.\xc2\xa0In the past, Stereolab\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 Sound-Dust\xc2\xa0tracks\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cNothing to Do With Me\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLes Bons Bons Des Raisons\xe2\x80\x9d functioned similarly.

b'Miles Okazaki',7.7,b'Trickster',0,b'Jazz',b'March 21 2017',"b'The jazz guitarist is more than able to lead both his band and the listener into far-off rhythmic and harmonic places, and crucially finds a way to bring everyone back, too.'","b'As a member of jazz saxophonist Steve Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s bands, guitarist Miles Okazaki has learned a few lessons about teasing. Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s music often skates near the R&B mood, while moving restlessly between frequent changes in rhythm and harmony. At its best, tunes by the MacArthur \xe2\x80\x9cGenius Grant\xe2\x80\x9d winner cycle through the compositional variety with such equanimity, you hardly realize that his ensemble has avoided giving up the straight-ahead funk. On Trickster, Okazaki\xe2\x80\x99s own music proves nearly as ingenious in its play with morphing grooves.' b'Opening track \xe2\x80\x9cKudzu\xe2\x80\x9d begins with a fast flourish: a long, knotty line, played with a clean tone by the guitarist. Then, over the rhythm section\xe2\x80\x99s unusual vamp, Okazaki restates some of this opening music, lingering over the material. Pianist Craig Taborn is in the mix, too, offering some mercurial chords. On a first pass, you might wonder: Where are we, exactly? Is this the main theme? The beginning of a strangely chill avant-garde solo? Before you have time to wallow in the uncertainty, Taborn and Okazaki join forces\xc2\xa0and display the song\xe2\x80\x99s real hook.' b""During performances like these, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that this bandleader is interested in the unstable realm of rhythm and melody, the place where it's easy to get lost. Though he won\xe2\x80\x99t leave you lost for long. On the slowly developing \xe2\x80\x9cThe Calendar,\xe2\x80\x9d Okazaki begins in a contemplative mood. By the end of the track, he solos with fevered inspiration, as if all of time is running out. Like Okazaki, drummer Sean Rickman and bassist Anthony Tidd are also graduates of the Coleman school, which means they make these darting, surprising structures sound fully natural."" b'Over the hurtling rhythm of \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Bolt,\xe2\x80\x9d one melodic cell travels through different octaves. You know it can\xe2\x80\x99t go on like that forever. This initial lack of a clear destination point creates a suspense that is resolved when the pianist and guitarist begin racing to complete the other\xe2\x80\x99s lines. After a stretch of roaming around in an attractive darkness, you get one clear payoff after another. During the brisk \xe2\x80\x9cCaduceus,\xe2\x80\x9d the interplay between Tidd, Taborn, and Okazaki results in glorious braids of melody. The execution is obviously complex, the work of virtuosi. But the resulting beauty is easy to appreciate.' b'Some performances on Trickster don\xe2\x80\x99t quite manage to replicate that feat. A few of the obsessive phrases on the album stop just short of turning into memorable compositions (as with \xe2\x80\x9cBox in a Box\xe2\x80\x9d). Fortunately, some of the songs that sound the least like puzzles reveal that Okazaki can craft simpler themes that are just as stirring. \xe2\x80\x9cMischief\xe2\x80\x9d is anchored by a strutting beat, one that fans of the Meters should appreciate. The relative stability of the song\xe2\x80\x99s pulse allows Taborn the freedom to uncork one of his lengthy, exciting solos. And the miniature \xe2\x80\x9cBorderland\xe2\x80\x9d offers the album a lyrical coda. While Okazaki can be plenty entertaining as a master of misdirection, he also has a gift for direct communication.'"
b'Joakim',7.2,b'Samurai',0,b'Electronic',b'March 21 2017',"b'The eclectic new album from French\xc2\xa0DJ and producer Joakim is unified only in\xc2\xa0its consistent oddity. He avoids conventional song structures, drawing\xc2\xa0inspiration from\xc2\xa0new age, funk, and krautrock.'","b'For much of his career, the French producer/DJ Joakim has primed his audience for jarring stylistic switches.\xc2\xa0Scan his wide-ranging credit list:\xc2\xa0This is a man who has helped\xc2\xa0mix Cassius\xe2\x80\x99 dance music as well as\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0tribute to atmospheric soundtrack master John Carpenter, who has reworked both Tiga\xe2\x80\x99s lurid house and J.J. Cale\xe2\x80\x99s adult contemporary. He\xe2\x80\x99s covered\xc2\xa0William Onyeabor\xc2\xa0in addition to\xc2\xa0Neil Young. But despite Joakim\xe2\x80\x99s mutability, the 40-year-old has always returned to a home base in the neighborhood of disco and rock on his recordings, grounding his capricious tendencies with a groove or a backbeat.' b'However, Joakim\xe2\x80\x99s latest trick is to mostly abandon any expectation\xc2\xa0of straightforward dance-rock on Samurai. Some precedent for this could\xc2\xa0be cobbled together from his past albums\xe2\x80\x99 subtler moments, which were occasionally\xc2\xa0overshadowed by overtly adrenaline-boosting tracks. These include the gurgling synth ramp-up \xe2\x80\x9cChapter 1,\xe2\x80\x9d which kicked off 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Tropics of Love, and especially \xe2\x80\x9cPeter Pan Over the Bronx,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPalo Alto,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTanabata,\xe2\x80\x9d three songs that defined the whimsical side\xc2\xa0of 2007\xe2\x80\x99s Monsters & Silly Songs. Other clues about *Samurai\xe2\x80\x99*s origins were provided by Joakim himself, who put together a Soundcloud mixtape of his influences, which he said \xe2\x80\x9crange from new age to yacht rock, from \xe2\x80\x9980s synth-based funk to Japanese electronic avant-garde, from krautrock to futuristic dystopian electronic music.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Accordingly,\xc2\xa0the producer frequently avoids conventional song structures on Samurai. So\xc2\xa0don\xe2\x80\x99t show up looking\xc2\xa0for\xc2\xa0the reassuring waves of most house or techno, or the comfort of verse-chorus-verse pop. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much singing on the album, and the\xc2\xa0vocals are often hard to make out. This music is placid, uninterested in using speed as an easy gimmick to get\xc2\xa0your attention.\xc2\xa0Instead, dodges and destabilizations are common.' b'In \xe2\x80\x9cMind Bent,\xe2\x80\x9d the synths level up slowly\xe2\x80\x94imagine stretching and pulling Kool and the Gang\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSummer Madness\xe2\x80\x9d to the consistency of taffy\xe2\x80\x94and a long tail of drums clatters and knocks about. This builds suspense, but Joakim never delivers a payoff. \xe2\x80\x9cCannibale Pastorale\xe2\x80\x9d is filled with blipping, chirping noises, like a pack of gossiping dolphins or chattering R2-D2s. These begin to acquire a beauty of their own after a while, but then Joakim interjects a crass barrage of drums, souring the song\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful qualities.' b'Though Samurai can sometimes feel like an art-school exercise in unpredictability, the majority of the music is easy on the ears. And it never stays in one place for long, so anything grating soon passes you by. There are\xc2\xa0rivulets of watery saxophone, and a handful of cheerful, bass-popping funk riffs that could have introduced segments on a local news channel in the \xe2\x80\x9980s. There are claps of distant thunder, bird sounds, and genial, wildly unthreatening metallic noises that suggest wind chimes and dinner gongs. Freed from the desire to make people move, Joakim put together a record that\xe2\x80\x99s unified in its oddity.'"

Ever since they first erected their wall of squall on 1985\xe2\x80\x99s Psychocandy, brothers Jim and William Reid have remained permanent residents of a world where sunglasses never come off, cigarette smoke doubles as dry ice, and the only illumination is provided by strobe light. None of the albums they\xe2\x80\x99ve released since has sounded quite the same, but they all invariably feel the same. As the Mary Chain\xe2\x80\x99s first full-length since the late \xe2\x80\x9990s proves, it will take more than a nearly two-decade recording hiatus to diminish the band\xe2\x80\x99s intrinsic ultraviolet vibe.' b'Despite the epic lag between releases, Damage and Joy feels very much like a logical extension of its predecessor,\xc2\xa01998\xe2\x80\x99s seeming swan song\xc2\xa0Munki,\xc2\xa0because the Reids had been unwittingly leaving a breadcrumb trail between the two records this whole time.

In the case, of \xe2\x80\x9cAll Things Pass,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s a revved-up revamp of the lone song the Mary Chain have officially released since the Reids buried the hatchet back in 2007 (because, presumably, leaving it for dead on the \xe2\x80\x9cHeroes\xe2\x80\x9d soundtrack seemed too ignoble a fate).

The brothers made the record with producer/bassist Youth (with support from touring drummer Brian Young and Lush bassist Phil King), and it feels more like an intimate recording project than a live band document, mostly splitting the difference between routine electro-Stones rave-ups and strung-out ballads. The Reids score most consistently in the latter category, likely because it forces them to keep their adolescent id in check and deal with more adult emotions. The illicit-affair account \xe2\x80\x9cBlack and Blues\xe2\x80\x9d is gilded gospel Americana dressed up in Velvet-y \xe2\x80\x9cba ba bas\xe2\x80\x9d and a winsome guest vocal from Sky Ferreira, who\xe2\x80\x99s thus far batting 1.000 in duets with Scottish rock institutions.

Where they were once defined by a collision of face-melting feedback and soothing melody, the modern-day Mary Chain are governed by a different set of extremes: the pent-up desire to act like goofy, hormonal teenagers and the sobering knowledge those days are long gone.

Their first full-length, 1988\xe2\x80\x99s Ultramega OK,\xc2\xa0expands upon the promise offered by their two Sub Pop EPs, the careening Screaming Life\xc2\xa0and the glitchy, funked-up Fopp. The band\xe2\x80\x99s assault is sharper and more focused, their musical ideas borrowing from blues (and blooze), punk, tape-manipulation experiments, and dredged-in-mud riffing. It originally came out on the even-then-it-was-legendary punk label SST, although its 2017 reissue on Sub Pop puts a neat little bow on the band\xe2\x80\x99s long career. Soundgarden\xe2\x80\x99s path led them to arena tours and classic-rock-radio canonization, and Sub Pop has grown from a fanzine into a powerhouse, persisting and thriving through multiple independent-rock gold rushes. Both entities are keenly aware of their legacies\xe2\x80\x94and the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re worthy of exploration.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cFlower,\xe2\x80\x9d a swirling tale of a woman whose hard-partying lifestyle leads her to an early grave, opens Ultramega OK. Years after more straightforward Soundgarden tracks like the glittering \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Hole Sun\xe2\x80\x9d and the hiccuping \xe2\x80\x9cPretty Noose\xe2\x80\x9d became rock-radio staples, it\xe2\x80\x99s still one of the band\xe2\x80\x99s best pop offerings, anchored by a chug that blossoms out of gauzy reverb, given depth by sonics that recall a muddied-up copy of Physical Graffiti (guitarist Kim Thayil has said that the humming feedback came from him placing his guitar on the floor near his amp, then blowing on its strings). The arrangement is animated by Chris Cornell\xe2\x80\x99s gritted-teeth vocal performance, which only comes into full-voiced yawp briefly. Its appeal to both sides of MTV\xe2\x80\x99s late-\xe2\x80\x9980s late-night rock aisle\xe2\x80\x94Headbangers Ball and 120 Minutes\xe2\x80\x94presaged the eventual cultural dominance of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Seattle sound\xe2\x80\x9d and the alt-rock gold rush that followed.' b'Ultramega OK\xe2\x80\x99s most instructive lesson, though, is how that craved-for aesthetic stemmed from an ever-shifting ideal. The twisted thrash of \xe2\x80\x9cCircle of Power,\xe2\x80\x9d led by a gasping vocal from bassist Hiro Yamamoto, gets extra tense because of its momentary pauses for breath; the creeping-death march of \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond the Wheel\xe2\x80\x9d is sandwiched between the tape-warp interludes \xe2\x80\x9c665\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c667\xe2\x80\x9d and a masterful vocal by Cornell to give it extra eeriness at the height of PMRC-stoked mania about \xe2\x80\x9coccult music\xe2\x80\x9d; the sludgy cover of the blues chestnut \xe2\x80\x9cSmokestack Lightning,\xe2\x80\x9d which pairs Cornell\xe2\x80\x99s wail with the band\xe2\x80\x99s 45-at\xe2\x80\x9333 grind, flips the idea of cocky \xe2\x80\x9980s rockers taking on the blues face-first into a moss-swarmed bog. (\xe2\x80\x9cWe learned the Howlin\xe2\x80\x99 Wolf version,\xe2\x80\x9d Cornell told Sounds. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it had been covered a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d Yamamoto deflated Cornell\xe2\x80\x99s insistence: \xe2\x80\x9cI did and I told you not to put it on the record. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit crass\xe2\x80\x94a bit like getting B.B. King to sit up on stage with you.\xe2\x80\x9d) Humor was also key, as it was for so many of the band\xe2\x80\x99s compatriots; crediting the album-ending patch of tape hiss and amp-unplugging to \xe2\x80\x9cOne Minute of Silence\xe2\x80\x9d (an homage to his and Yoko Ono\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Minutes Silence\xe2\x80\x9d) is one of the album\xe2\x80\x99s more obvious jokes.' b'Skin Yard\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Endino, whose list of \xe2\x80\x9980s production credits could double as an early greatest-hits list for Sub Pop, remixed Ultramega OK for this reissue; Thayil\xe2\x80\x99s liner notes go into diplomatic depth about why the band was ultimately unhappy with the SST-released version of the album. Endino\xe2\x80\x99s tweaks don\xe2\x80\x99t render the album spit-shined, thank God, but they do accentuate certain instrumental details more clearly\xe2\x80\x94the clashing guitars on the loop-de-loop slacker portrait \xe2\x80\x9cHe Didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d the snap of Matt Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s drums on the paranoiac \xe2\x80\x9cHead Injury.\xe2\x80\x9d (The most notable difference between the two versions is the absence of then-labelmates Sonic Youth\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDeath Valley \xe2\x80\x9969,\xe2\x80\x9d a sample of which served as a radio-static-swathed transition between the sludge of \xe2\x80\x9cSmokestack Lightning\xe2\x80\x9d and the anxiety of \xe2\x80\x9cNazi Driver.\xe2\x80\x9d)' b'Endino\xe2\x80\x99s liner notes delve into the details of crafting the new mix\xe2\x80\x94sourcing the effects unit that made \xe2\x80\x9c665\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c667\xe2\x80\x9d so immediate and freaky, fixing a missing snare hit on \xe2\x80\x9cFlower.\xe2\x80\x9d Endino also recorded the early-stage versions of a few Ultramega OK tracks that round out this reissue; they add to the story by showing how much more precise the band got in the year or so after they recorded the Screaming Life EP, with the two versions of the single-chord grind \xe2\x80\x9cIncessant Mace\xe2\x80\x9d showing how that song\xe2\x80\x99s brimming dread was the result of a fair amount of experimentation.' b'Revisiting Ultramega OK, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious in retrospect that Soundgarden were going to clamber to an exalted position in rock. They managed to balance their mad-scientist tendencies with an innate savvy about how to craft a rock song\xe2\x80\x94even when they were six minutes long and based around one chord. The album captures the band on the eve of being swept into the major-label system, and it predicts how they would wring rock hits out of unexpected building blocks.'"
b'Spiral Stairs',6.4,b'Doris and the Daggers',0,b'Rock',b'March 20 2017',"b'His voice deeper and his aim truer, Pavement\xe2\x80\x99s Scott Kannberg is at his most confident and mellow as he navigates middle age\xe2\x80\x99s ups and downs.'","b'Former Pavement guitarist/vocalist\xc2\xa0Scott \xe2\x80\x9cSpiral Stairs\xe2\x80\x9d Kannberg\xe2\x80\x99s solo career has doubled as an ongoing battle for self-definition\xe2\x80\x94a quest to find space for himself in the firmament of American indie rock. Results have varied. There were guest spots on Kevin Drew and Broken Social Scene LPs. There was his label Amazing Grease\xc2\xa0Records, home to San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s late, great Oranger. Then there was the trio he helmed, Preston School of Industry. At its most memorable, Preston\xc2\xa0doubled down on the wilder-card songwriting role Kannberg played during Pavement\xe2\x80\x99s decade-long, indie-rock reign (the\xc2\xa0spazzy, elastic \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spaces in Between\xe2\x80\x9d) or probed fuzzed-out, country-fried drift (the downbeat \xe2\x80\x9cWhalebones\xe2\x80\x9d). Too often, though, the music floated by, not leaving behind much of an impression. With 2009\xe2\x80\x99s *The Real Feel**\xe2\x80\x94*his first LP as\xc2\xa0Spiral Stairs\xe2\x80\x94he gear-shifted, leaning convincingly and promisingly into folk, blues, and the Clean. Then, without warning, Kannberg effectively went\xc2\xa0silent.' b'Eight years later, *Doris and the Daggers *cracks the equation. His voice deeper and his aim truer, Kannberg is at his most confident and mellow here. Backed by members of the National, Broken Social Scene, Oranger, and singer/songwriter Kelley Stoltz, the album patiently navigates middle age\xe2\x80\x99s ups and downs, setting aside sprawl and fantasia aside to focus on succinctness and autobiography. The players lend a\xc2\xa0patient, casual\xc2\xa0calm to proceedings mid-tempo, sober,\xc2\xa0and pedal-steel soaked; these are indie-rock lite tunes\xc2\xa0playing a long game, in\xc2\xa0no\xc2\xa0rush to peak, freak, or wipe out.' b'With \xe2\x80\x9cThe Unconditional,\xe2\x80\x9d an ode to a growing daughter, Kannberg capitalizes on the song\xe2\x80\x99s elastic nest of guitars, horns, and organs, stretching and savoring each verse. You can feel him fully inhabit this song in a way he never has before;\xc2\xa0when he confides that the \xe2\x80\x9clittle\xc2\xa0girl\xe2\x80\x99s getting older/she\xe2\x80\x99s not telling me what to\xc2\xa0do,\xe2\x80\x9d the prevailing emotion is a rueful sense of wonder.\xc2\xa0Needled with riffs and horn squibs, \xe2\x80\x9cDance (Cry Wolf)\xe2\x80\x9d locates its swing and bounce in lonesomeness. \xe2\x80\x9cAWM\xe2\x80\x9d might be the most chipper, hummable divorce song this decade; its violins and pianos smartly deployed, its vocal outro more reflective than bitter. Less affecting\xc2\xa0is the goofy golf-trip remembrance \xe2\x80\x9cDundee Man\xe2\x80\x9d featuring a synthesizer line part of a wan, jangling whole. Though the album\xe2\x80\x99s stakes may not be very high at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to hear Kannberg\xe2\x80\x99s increasing\xc2\xa0facility for\xc2\xa0arrangements.' b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a record you crank in traffic en route to an across-town meeting; it\xe2\x80\x99s a record to unwind with later that night on your second glass of Syrah\xe2\x80\x94a sturdy shrug to cap off the day. Throughout Doris, a very tricky balancing act is at work: the maintenance of a rangey, ragged looseness, without any sense of over-rehearsal. That Kannberg and company are able to sustain this standard throughout\xe2\x80\x94even for synth-funk wonder \xe2\x80\x9cNo Comparison\xe2\x80\x9d and the chanted, semi-punk head rush of \xe2\x80\x9cDoris and the Daggers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a small triumph.'"
b'Obituary',7.6,b'Obituary',0,b'Metal',b'March 20 2017',"b'Floridian death metal veterans Obituary remain a beacon of consistency. This self-titled record is their most energetic effort since reforming in 2003, and it proves their vitality.'","b'Of the bands that define Florida death metal, which also\xc2\xa0strongly defines\xc2\xa0American Death Metal as a whole, Obituary remain\xc2\xa0a beacon of consistency. Beginning in 1984 under the Executioner moniker, Obituary built their sound around stripping the Gothic cobwebs off Celtic Frost\xe2\x80\x99s mid-paced riffing. They let the guitars become a\xc2\xa0humid swamp, thick and airy. Singer John Tardy defined death metal vocals by getting as guttural as guitarist Trevor Peres\xe2\x80\x99 rhythms, removing any last vestiges of thrashy snarling. Obituary have been held as models for keeping it simple, and\xc2\xa0for fans, the idea\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0a new album from them\xc2\xa0can seem predictable. But their\xc2\xa0self-titled 10th record proves Obituary\xc2\xa0don\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0suffer for sticking\xc2\xa0to their identity.' b'Peres and drummer Donald Tardy remain at the heart of Obituary and feed off each other in a way few death metal bands do. Peres sounds more mangled when Donald speeds up, and already thick riffs feel impenetrable as\xc2\xa0his drumming slows. As such, Peres\xe2\x80\x99 low, groveling guitar tone is more flexible than it seems. Obituary\xc2\xa0begins with two faster numbers, \xe2\x80\x9cBrave\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSentence Day\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94affirmations that they\xe2\x80\x99re not giving up anytime soon. Both are busy for a band who prefers to let a groovy riff sink in, and John in particular lunges\xc2\xa0with a youthfulness that rivals the band\xe2\x80\x99s heyday in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s and early \xe2\x80\x9990s.' b'Some of Obituary\xe2\x80\x99s best work has come\xc2\xa0from letting flashiness creep in. In 1990, for example,\xc2\xa0Cause of Death\xc2\xa0had its sludge punctured by James Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s divebombs and neoclassically-influenced soloing. That album contained\xc2\xa0their most developed songwriting in terms of leads. Likewise,\xc2\xa0thanks to Ken Andrews\xe2\x80\x99 lead work here,\xc2\xa0Obituary\xc2\xa0is their most energetic record since reforming in 2003 (they originally disbanded in \xe2\x80\x9997). On\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cshredder\xe2\x80\x9d records, the disconnect between the fireworks of the guitarist and the tepid rhythm section can be jarring. But Peres and Donald\xe2\x80\x99s strong foundation keeps that from happening.' b'Andrews can also bow to death metal tradition, as he does with the spaced-out, Death-like leads in \xe2\x80\x9cKneel Before Me.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cSentence\xe2\x80\x9d ends with a one-man guitar battle, as Andrews heralds\xc2\xa0not just the dueling harmonies of Judas Priest\xe2\x80\x99s Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing but also Slayer\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic interplay between Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. He\xe2\x80\x99s not just versatile; he sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s genuinely excited. And that exuberance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t arise from nowhere\xe2\x80\x94Donald and Andrews were once members of Andrew W.K.\xe2\x80\x99s backing band.' b'This record honors all of Obituary\xe2\x80\x99s history by not compromising. Its reliability is peppered with\xc2\xa0unrest. Obituary\xc2\xa0ends the opposite of how it began\xe2\x80\x94slow and yet somehow impatient. \xe2\x80\x9cStraight to Hell\xe2\x80\x9d recalls the dim flickering-light riffs of 1992\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe End Complete,\xe2\x80\x9d resulting in a seediness that\xe2\x80\x99s constantly promised in death metal and rarely achieved. \xe2\x80\x9cTurned Into Stone\xe2\x80\x9d centers\xc2\xa0their Celtic Frost worship, a more gradual unsettling than some of the record\xe2\x80\x99s faster pillages. With these contrasts, Obituary show they\xe2\x80\x99re keenly aware of dynamics in a way most bands could stand to afford. In 2017, the challenge for a veteran metal act is to not relentlessly innovate, but to mine any small new parts of their sound. Kreator and Immolation have proved successful in this regard already, and Obituary, while sticking closer to their roots, have also proven their vitality here.'"

It's\xc2\xa0unusually electrifying.""","b'ADULT.\xe2\x80\x99s Nicola Kuperus and Adam Lee Miller have always had a hermetic aesthetic. Their synthesizers sound like museum pieces; their post-punk production reeks like a leaky dungeon. And their dry sense of humor keeps the listener perpetually off balance, the same way that their creepy cover art steadfastly refuses to meet the viewer\xe2\x80\x99s gaze. You never see a pair of eyes on the duo\xe2\x80\x99s record sleeves\xe2\x80\x94just covered faces, gloved hands, and ambiguously slumped poses, markers of contemporary alienation raised to the level of high art. If you were to describe their music in architectural terms, it would be part hall of mirrors, part Winchester Mystery House.' b'For Detroit House Guests, their first album in four\xc2\xa0years, the married duo\xe2\x80\x94both are visual artists and filmmakers as well as musicians\xe2\x80\x94went the opposite route: Assisted by a $40,000 Knight Foundation grant, they threw open the doors of their 4,000-square-foot compound in Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s New Center neighborhood, inviting a handpicked succession of artists to live and work with them. Some, like Nitzer Ebb\xe2\x80\x99s Douglas J. McCarthy, they had known for years. The Austrian Thereminist Dorit Chrysler, on the other hand, had only a passing acquaintance with the duo before her residency. It was an \xe2\x80\x9cintense\xe2\x80\x9d process, Kuperus has said: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you\xe2\x80\x99re living together, you\xe2\x80\x99re having breakfast together, and when you\xe2\x80\x99re done with the studio you\xe2\x80\x99re watching Netflix together.\xe2\x80\x9d That kind of intimacy is palpable across the album. While there\xe2\x80\x99s no mistaking ADULT.\xe2\x80\x99s wiry signature, their collaborators\xe2\x80\x99 input is largely indistinguishable from their own, leading to a record that is richer and stranger than anything the duo has done before.' b'All of their usual hallmarks are here: spring-loaded drum programming, clammy reverb, brittle synths that clink like wind chimes in an ice storm. Classic electro remains a driving force, and on \xe2\x80\x9cStop (and Start Again),\xe2\x80\x9d featuring Light Asylum\xe2\x80\x99s Shannon Funchess bellowing over a flanged, high-necked bassline, they return to the hair-raising goth of 2005\xe2\x80\x99s Gimme Trouble. But a majority of the album\xe2\x80\x99s tracks find them foraging far beyond their usual stomping grounds. The opening \xe2\x80\x9cP rts M ss ng,\xe2\x80\x9d with Lichens\xe2\x80\x99 Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe, is slow and methodical, its modular synthesizers twitching like metal shavings under a magnet. \xe2\x80\x9cBreathe On,\xe2\x80\x9d with Swans\xe2\x80\x99 Michael Gira, extends the meditative mood; Gira\xe2\x80\x99s basso purr verges on ASMR territory, and the same could be said of the woozy third track, \xe2\x80\x9cInto the Drum,\xe2\x80\x9d with its disorienting soup of whispers and vocal fry.' b'In fact, they don\xe2\x80\x99t unleash their usual body-moving assault until the fourth song, \xe2\x80\x9cWe Are a Mirror,\xe2\x80\x9d a chilly slab of death disco enlivened by Kuperus and McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s call-and-response vocals. Just like his hosts, McCarthy sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s ventured far from his comfort zone. Neither of his songs bear obvious traces of Nitzer Ebb\xe2\x80\x99s abrasive legacy; instead, he seems determined to twist his formidable baritone into the most unexpected shapes. Ironically, it falls to Funchess to deliver the album\xe2\x80\x99s best Nitzer Ebb impersonation: Her \xe2\x80\x9cWe Chase the Sound\xe2\x80\x9d is a dead ringer for the EBM pioneers\xe2\x80\x99 scorched-earth funk.' b'Throughout, ADULT.\xe2\x80\x99s synthetic sound world is unusually electrifying. On \xe2\x80\x9cInexhaustible,\xe2\x80\x9d abetted by Chrysler\xe2\x80\x99s Theremin, they conjure a mercurial fusion of Morton Subotnick and early Depeche Mode.

b'Wailing Souls',8.7,b'Wailing',0,b'Global',b'March 19 2017',"b'As Jamaica stood at a political crossroads in 1980, the Wailing Souls worked with famed engineer\xc2\xa0Scientist on a magical blend of unearthly dub and traditional\xc2\xa0songcraft.'","b'Jamaica had two realities then: a tropical paradise of sandy beaches, crystal blue seas, and feel-good music; the other, a nation overrun by violent drug posses, permanently scarred by a recent history of CIA intervention and subversion, and a deeper historical legacy of slavery and colonization. The question of which reality would prevail seemed to hang heavy in the air in 1980, as the Wailing Souls recorded their album Wailing\xe2\x80\x94an album shaped by its earthly means and sung to the angelic spheres.' b'At the turn of the new decade, the post-independence euphoria that had defined Jamaica in the 1960s and the strident self-determination that defined the \xe2\x80\x9970s gave way to a new era of\xc2\xa0garrison politics, an unprecedented level of political violence (over 800 people killed in Kingston in the months leading up to the October elections), and the bloody\xc2\xa0consequences of Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s increasing role in the regional cocaine trade. The utopian vision of Rastafari\xe2\x80\x94the Afro-Jamaican religion that preached a return to nature and repatriation to the ancestral African homeland\xe2\x80\x94was being rapidly eclipsed by the hard local realities of the country\xe2\x80\x99s position as a regional pawn in the Cold War and the effects of global free trade policies.' b'The music scene could not help but be affected by these shifts. If the ascension of Bob Marley and the influence of Rastafari on roots reggae were dramatic developments of the 1970s, the next dramatic turning point occurred in 1984 when producers abandoned the recording of live bands altogether, in favor of the stripped-down, pre-programmed rhythms of cheap Casio keyboards. These producers initially attempted to replicate the old reggae dancehall sound, but once the music went digital, it rapidly evolved into a radically different animal. Of course, the mechanization of Jamaican music followed a pattern that was already well underway in the United States and other parts of the world. But for those who had listened to reggae for its spiritual or political qualities or its earthy, organic sensibility, something seemed irretrievably lost.' b'The pre-digital early 1980s were a period of transition between these two dramatic eras of Jamaican music, an interregnum that symbolically began with the death of Bob Marley in May of 1981. Although many groups of the roots reggae era adapted to the new era and continued to make great music, the new style was largely defined by a younger generation of dancehall deejays with names like Yellowman, Charlie Chaplin, Josey Wales, Eek-A-Mouse, Tiger and others whose \xe2\x80\x9cslackness\xe2\x80\x9d lyrics of sex, ghetto violence, braggadocio and bling helped set the more aggressive tone of the new decade.' b'This new form of reggae, generally called \xe2\x80\x9cdancehall,\xe2\x80\x9d was associated with a number of emerging producers including Sugar Minott, Nkrumah Jah Thomas, Linval Thompson and Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, Henry \xe2\x80\x9cJunjo\xe2\x80\x9d Lawes. Lawes in particular was on a hot streak during these years, best-known for the string of hits he produced with Yellowman. His unique sound was partially crafted by using the Roots Radics as his session band. The Radics were built around the rhythm section nucleus of Errol \xe2\x80\x9cFlabba\xe2\x80\x9d Holt, drummer Lincoln \xe2\x80\x9cStyle\xe2\x80\x9d Scott, and guitarist Eric \xe2\x80\x9cBingy Bunny\xe2\x80\x9d Lamont (augmented by a number of keyboardists including Winston Wright and Gladstone Anderson), and their sound was stripped-down and stark. Unlike the older, polyrhythmic roots reggae which had developed out of rock steady, the new rhythms tended to be minimalist in construction\xe2\x80\x94at times martially tight and at other times heavy and lumbering\xe2\x80\x94with Scott\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrums garnishing the music with electronic beeps, buzzes and other quirky, futuristic sounds.' b'But the unique vibe of Lawes\xe2\x80\x99 productions was also a result of them being mixed by Hopeton \xe2\x80\x9cScientist\xe2\x80\x9d Brown, a young prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of King Tubby, the acknowledged master of dub music. Scientist had initially been a mere apprentice at Tubby\xe2\x80\x99s studio, only infrequently mixing until Thompson and Junjo started to use him on a regular basis. But his skills and reputation grew quickly and by 1980, he was mixing most of Junjo\xe2\x80\x99s tunes and dub versions, compiling them on to the series of sci-fi and video game-themed albums that still form the core of his reputation today: Scientist Rids the World of\xc2\xa0the Evil Curse of the Vampires, Scientist Wins the World Cup, Heavyweight Dub Champion, Big Showdown, Scientist Meets the Space Invaders and Scientist Encounters Pac-Man. Unlike the warmer, more tropical sound of King Tubby\xe2\x80\x99s dub mixing which had dominated the 1970s, Scientist\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the Roots Radics\xe2\x80\x99 sounded as if he were suspended in the cold, stark spaces between planets, its emptiness only occasionally animated by the fleeting movements of comets, asteroids, and space debris.' b'Although dub music developed out of reggae as the latter music\xe2\x80\x99s experimental impulse, the two approaches have generally tended to appeal to different constituencies. Inside of Jamaica, dub was most typically used in the dancehalls as a backdrop for the tale-spinning of the sound system deejays. Outside of Jamaica, it tended to appeal to listeners whose ears had been primed by the spacey soundscapes of psychedelic rock. And producers generally encouraged this bifurcation, placing vocal songs on the A-sides of singles and dub versions on the B-sides. But there were occasions when the idea of the song and the dub mix were not necessarily mutually exclusive, and there is a select group of exalted reggae recordings that unite the sonic experimentation of dub with more traditional conceptions of songcraft. The best-known example of this is probably the Congos\xe2\x80\x99 1977 album Heart of the Congos, a collection of songs gorgeously performed by the Congos and given an equally gorgeous, dubwise production by Lee \xe2\x80\x9cScratch\xe2\x80\x9d Perry at the height of his Black Ark studio.' b'A lesser-known album in the same category is the Wailing Souls album Wailing. The core of the Wailing Souls is the duo of Winston \xe2\x80\x9cPipe\xe2\x80\x9d Matthews and Lloyd \xe2\x80\x9cBread\xe2\x80\x9d McDonald, generally augmented by one or two additional vocalists as the occasion demands. Friends of Bob Marley & the Wailers since their early days singing together in Trench Town, they were\xe2\x80\x94along with the Abyssinians, the Gladiators, and Burning Spear\xe2\x80\x94one of a number of roots vocal groups that began to record for Coxsone Dodd at Studio One in the early 1970s. The Wailing Souls brought a poignant, yearning sound associated on one hand with musical traditions of the Jamaican countryside and on the other, with African-American soul outfits\xc2\xa0like\xc2\xa0the Impressions and the Temptations, who inspired the formation of scores of Jamaican vocal groups. Many of the latter had perfected their gentle harmonizing singing rock steady\xe2\x80\x94the romantic, soul-inspired Jamaican music that, for two or three intense years, set the stage for roots reggae. But by the early 1970s, they had abandoned the smooth crooning of rock steady for a raw, less affected vocal quality, typified by the rough voices of Pipe, Bob Marley, and Burning Spear\xe2\x80\x99s Winston Rodney.' b'Like the other groups, the Wailing Souls typically sung themes of Rastafarian devotion alongside philosophically-tinged love songs. They cut two albums\xc2\xa0for Coxsone before moving on to Channel One studio, where they cut a string of excellent records for the Hoo-Kim brothers. Their career took a major step forward in 1979\xc2\xa0when they recorded the celebrated Wild Suspense album for Island Records. By the time they began to record for Junjo in 1980, their experience enabled them to blend the romanticism of rock steady and the mysticism and militancy of roots reggae with the new, minimalist dub sound Scientist was crafting for Junjo\xe2\x80\x99s productions. Teaming up with Junjo and Scientist when both were at the peak of their creativity, Pipe\xe2\x80\x99s voice has arguably never been showcased to better effect, and Wailing was to be one of the most special albums of the Souls\xe2\x80\x99 long career.' b'In fact, the group was initially reluctant to work with Junjo, wary of the gangster element in the producer\xe2\x80\x99s business, not to mention quality control issues. Junjo was one of the producers that made extensive use of versioning\xe2\x80\x94recycling a rhythm track by overdubbing a succession of deejays on it\xe2\x80\x94but the Souls preferred their music to stand alone so that the messages in their song lyrics remained accessible. Furthermore, while the rhythms that Junjo was cutting with Roots Radics undoubtedly hit hard in the dancehall, they sometimes lacked the inventiveness of the rhythms produced by earlier drum & bass teams like Sly Dunbar\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Robbie Shakespeare (with Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru), Carlton & Aston Barrett (with Bob Marley & the Wailers) and \xe2\x80\x9cSanta\xe2\x80\x9d Davis and Fully Fulwood (with Soul Syndicate). But the Souls\xe2\x80\x99 warm four-part harmonies and Rasta themes (filled out on this album by Garth Dennis and George \xe2\x80\x9cBuddy\xe2\x80\x9d Haye) brought a sonic and philosophical depth to those rhythms that Junjo\xe2\x80\x99s usual deejays never could.' b'From Scott\xe2\x80\x99s opening drum roll, the entire album is suffused with a feeling of the otherworldly, with the pensive chorus of Bread, Haye, and Dennis mixed like phantoms behind Pipe\xe2\x80\x99s lead vocals, juxtaposed against the stark, hard rhythms of the Roots Radics and spaced-out by Scientist in a haze of echo and reverberation. The lyrics are generally understated, tending toward the poetic, the oblique, and the evocative. The album\xe2\x80\x99s centerpiece is\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWho No Waan Come Cyan Stay\xe2\x80\x9d (Who Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Want to Come Can\xe2\x80\x99t Stay), a languid, spacey paean of Rasta repatriation. Anyone doubting the emotional power of dub need only let themselves be transported by Scott\xe2\x80\x99s snare chopping up the soundscape like gunshots, his bass drum kicking up thick clouds of reverberation, and Flabba Holt\xe2\x80\x99s bass ringing out with analog delay like a buoy on the sea while Pipe beckons to non-believers one last time as he departs for a heavenly African Zion:' b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh give us a home\nWhere the butterflies roam\nand the birds sing so sweet\xe2\x80\xa6' b'Who no waan come cyan stay\nYou can stay, for I am going' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s so long, so long\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been warning you\nYet you\xe2\x80\x99re trying hard not to accept my word\nBut when the master\xe2\x80\x99s calling\nYou will find yourself stumbling\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll be waiting by the wayside' b'Who no waan come cyan stay\nYou can stay for I am going\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The other songs continue in the same vein with wistful melodies of love, mystery, foreboding, and Rastafarian devotion. The opener \xe2\x80\x9cPenny I Love You\xe2\x80\x9d is poetic and philosophical, with the Souls professing their love into the echo chamber and setting the stage for the rest of the album. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Be Down Hearted\xe2\x80\x9d is a jaunty, spiritual exhortation for the Rasta faithful. \xe2\x80\x9cRudy Say Him Bad\xe2\x80\x9d is a plea to the gun-toting \xe2\x80\x9crude boys\xe2\x80\x9d of Kingston to heed the advice of their elders and renounce their violent ways, lest they \xe2\x80\x9clay down to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFace the Devil\xe2\x80\x9d is rooted in the Biblical book of Revelation, warning of divine retribution and apocalyptic horrors to come. The album closes with the steady, plaintive \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Big More,\xe2\x80\x9d with Pipe and the Souls calling out the wealthy for their greed\xc2\xa0while bemoaning the plight of suffering masses. In true \xe2\x80\x9cshowcase album\xe2\x80\x9d fashion almost all of the songs here are followed by their dub versions, with the vocals entirely removed and Scientist kicking around in the echo chamber, using reverberation and dropping out parts to explore every nook, cranny, and cavern of the soundscape.' b'The juxtaposition of the Roots Radics\xe2\x80\x99 dancehall rhythms and the rhapsodic voices of the Wailing Souls seemed to encapsulate Jamaica\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at the crossroads of 1980, a moment when the violent changing of the political guard foreshadowed a new era for the island as a whole. In a tense and uncertain season when the smooth harmonizing of vocal groups was giving way to the raucous chanting of the dancehall deejays, the team of Junjo, Scientist, and the Wailing Souls managed to carve an exalted dub cathedral out of the hard rhythms of early dancehall. Casting the group as voices in the proverbial wilderness, Wailing sings the glories of love, while bemoaning the violence engulfing their society and the world, an angelically-voiced clarion call as society gradually arcs toward the dark side.' b'__' b'Michael E.

Over solemn piano chords and a lockstep electro groove that hints at the cadence of a protest march, Gahan laments how \xe2\x80\x9cwe feel nothing inside\xe2\x80\x9d as we \xe2\x80\x9ctrack it all with satellites\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwatch men die in real time.\xe2\x80\x9d By track two, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the Revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d Gahan begins\xc2\xa0calling for out-and-out revolt, chiding the audience: \xe2\x80\x9cCome on people/You\xe2\x80\x99re letting me down.\xe2\x80\x9d In his golden-throated baritone, Gahan reminds us that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9cpissed on/For too long,\xe2\x80\x9d our \xe2\x80\x9crights abused\xe2\x80\x9d by governments who \xe2\x80\x9cManipulate and threaten/With terror as a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Apparently, principal lyricist and songwriter Martin Gore is no longer content to focus all his attention on the spiritual searching that has defined Depeche Mode\xe2\x80\x99s music for more than\xc2\xa030 years. Over that time, few artists have so artfully portrayed the inner dialogue between redemption and indulgence. By the band\xe2\x80\x99s 1990 breakout Violator, Gore had basically invented his own syntax for the human condition as a purgatorial struggle between sinful pleasures and a yearning for higher peace. And Gahan, with his ability to invest urgency, soul, and a feeling of debauched weariness into subjects like S&M and tortured love, has never failed to translate Gore\xe2\x80\x99s restless malaise to the throngs who fill stadiums to connect with it. Gahan turns despair into sex appeal unlike no other. But this time, he\xe2\x80\x99s tasked with looking up from his satin, regret-stained sheets and making us believe that an aging rock star really cares about civil unrest.' b'Gahan delivers Gore\xe2\x80\x99s state-of-world address for three songs in a row before going back to the band\xe2\x80\x99s bread-and-butter obsessions. Later, though, on \xe2\x80\x9cPoorman\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which self-consciously references the spartan electronic gurgle of the Violator hit \xe2\x80\x9cPolicy of Truth\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Gore and Gahan risk coming off as oblivious to the irony when they observe that \xe2\x80\x9ccorporations get the breaks/Keeping almost everything they make\xe2\x80\x9d and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will it trickle down?\xe2\x80\x9d But Depeche Mode deliver anthems with such proficiency that sincerity barely matters. A song like \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the Revolution\xe2\x80\x9d makes you feel like singing in response to today\xe2\x80\x99s headlines. Depeche Mode still make universal, stadium-sized music that\xe2\x80\x99s limber enough to fit through your bedroom doorframe, as if it had been conceived with your life in mind.' b'In some respects, though, their consistency works against them. The sixth album since the departure of multi-instrumentalist/arranger Alan Wilder, Spirit sees Depeche Mode once again shuffling through the most quintessential components of their sound.\xc2\xa0On \xe2\x80\x9cCover Me,\xe2\x80\x9d Gore\xe2\x80\x99s haunting Lanois-esque guitar twang allows you to close your eyes and picture yourself under the Northern lights Gahan sings about. But aside from \xe2\x80\x9cCover Me,\xe2\x80\x9d Spirit lacks the ambience of Depeche Mode\xe2\x80\x99s most atmospheric material. If only producer/mixer James Ford (Florence and the Machine, Foals, Arctic Monkeys) had disheveled the sounds a bit, Spirit could have better asserted its place in\xc2\xa0Depeche Mode\xe2\x80\x99s body of work.' b'Instead, Ford\xe2\x80\x94who is also one half of the electronic duo Simian Mobile Disco\xe2\x80\x94mimics the vibe of the band\xe2\x80\x99s iconic work with producer Flood. But even Flood didn\xe2\x80\x99t imitate himself when he mixed\xc2\xa0the last DM album, 2013\xe2\x80\x99s far more creatively resolute Delta Machine. Nevertheless, this is\xc2\xa0a band whose effortlessness can misguide you into thinking they\xe2\x80\x99re not trying. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled. In the bridge of \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the Revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Gahan repeats the line \xe2\x80\x9cthe train is coming, the train is coming... get on board.\xe2\x80\x9d You can draw inspiration from that lyric whether or not you take to the streets or petition your elected officials. Gore\xe2\x80\x99s directive is less about activism and more about opening your heart so that it guides your conscience. For him, the term \xe2\x80\x9cspirit\xe2\x80\x9d has come to encompass politics, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fueled by the same eros that\xe2\x80\x99s driven the band\xe2\x80\x99s music since day one. Which is why Spirit is so convincing in spite of its radical shift in tenor. For both the band and audience, that shift couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come at a better time.'"
b'The Creation',8.7,b'Action Painting',1,b'Rock',b'March 18 2017',"b'The psychedelic\xc2\xa0mod band were only around for a few years, but as this Numero compilation overwhelmingly proves, they were as self-aware as the Move, as vicious as the Who, and as clever as the Kinks.'","b""The Creation are\xc2\xa0the definition of a cult band. They only existed for a brief spell\xe2\x80\x94formed in 1966, fell apart in 1968\xe2\x80\x94 but during those months, they bore a sound that could\xe2\x80\x99ve made them stars. Adding to the Creation\xe2\x80\x99s mystique is the fact that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t widely heard at the time. In their native Britain, they eked out only one hit, \xe2\x80\x9cPainter Man,\xe2\x80\x9d which scraped the Top 40 at No. 36. But that\xe2\x80\x99s better than they managed in the U.S., where they essentially didn't exist; their four singles stiffed and the haphazard 1967 LP We Are Paintermen never even materialized in America."" b'Eurodisco outfit Boney M took their cover \xe2\x80\x9cPainter Man\xe2\x80\x9d into the UK Top 10 in 1979, but that had little to do with the cult of the Creation that was already well underway. The first true flowering of Creation awareness arrived in 1978, when the Jam conspicuously framed a Creation 45\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cBiff Bang Pow,\xe2\x80\x9d the flipside of \xe2\x80\x9cPainter Man\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in their collage of inspiration and self-celebration in the inner sleeve for All Mod Cons. By the early \xe2\x80\x9980s, Television Personalities were covering their songs and the band\xe2\x80\x99s chief advocate Alan McGee formed a label called Creation and named his indie band after \xe2\x80\x9cBiff Bang Pow.\xe2\x80\x9d Fan devotion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come much clearer than that.' b""By that point, Edsel released How Does It Feel To Feel, the first in a series of Creation compilations created for British Invasion, freakbeat and psych collectors. Many similar collections have appeared over the last three decades, but Numero\xe2\x80\x99s new double-disc Action Painting is the first Creation compilation designed to appeal to listeners who might not already know them. It\xe2\x80\x99s for people who may be aware of the band through the indelible impression \xe2\x80\x9cMakin' Time\xe2\x80\x9d made in Wes Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s 1998 film Rushmore, or perhaps Ride\xe2\x80\x99s cover of \xe2\x80\x9cHow Does It Feel To Feel\xe2\x80\x9d in 1994, or maybe they just trust Numero\xe2\x80\x99s curation of the forgotten corners of our musical past."" b'Action Painting certainly contains its own collector bait\xe2\x80\x94the first disc includes remasters of the band\xe2\x80\x99s original mono mixes supervised by their producer Shel Talmy, while the second contains all the previously un-reissued early sides the group cut as the Mark Four along with new stereo mixes\xe2\x80\x94but its value is in presenting the work of this extraordinary band in an easily digestible fashion. The sequencing of Action Painting gives their short, turbulent life some coherence, presenting a narrative where the group keeps kicking against the pricks of their time.' b'For outsiders, Shel Talmy may provide the best gateway to the Creation. Talmy produced the earliest hits of the Kinks and the Who (he\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the proto-metal blast of \xe2\x80\x9cYou Really Got Me\xe2\x80\x9d and the sneering defiance of \xe2\x80\x9cMy Generation\xe2\x80\x9d) and the Creation benefitted from his blunt touch. On his productions, Talmy ratcheted up the violent pop-art of the Who when they were at the peak of their mod swagger, a move that was only fitting for a band who seemed to exist in an eternal now, simultaneously hoovering up ideas from R&B-besotted mods and mind-bending psychedelia. In that sense, the Creation sometimes flirted with the subversion of the Move, but where Roy Wood often indulged in irony, the Creation were sincere, never raising an arched eyebrow when conjuring waves of noise and grounding their whimsy with truly nasty, gnarled guitar riffs.' b'The creation existed in a hot house between mod and psychedelia, ranging between the fevered stomp of the former and the mind-warping experimentation of the latter. Listen to \xe2\x80\x9cSylvette,\xe2\x80\x9d one of their earliest numbers: it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially a rewrite of Eddie Holland\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLeaving Here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94notably covered by the Who on their 1965 debut My Generation\xe2\x80\x94but the Creation feels coiled and lethal, as if they were deliberately keeping their full power in check. One of their chief attributes is that they sounded\xc2\xa0almost vicious.' b'Innovation never played into the Creation\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. Guitarist Eddie Phillips sawed a violin bow across his six strings, a move Jimmy Page would steal, but the band embodied their time more than transcended it. The feeling that the band was always on the cusp of a breakthrough is what makes them exciting to this day. Particularly in the mono mixes that comprise disc one, they are vibrant and alive, sometimes hinting at the clean lines and big beat of mod, but usually sounding like the bold explosion of pop art. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pull you into a cerebral undercurrent the way the best psychedelia does, it just detonates. \xe2\x80\x9cBiff Bang Pow\xe2\x80\x9d takes its name from comic art\xe2\x80\x94the title suggests the hyper-stylized Batman series of 1966\xe2\x80\x94and it rampages like the Who on a bender and it never makes a play for the head. Even \xe2\x80\x9cHow Does It Feel To Feel\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a churning circle that suggests psychedelic obsession\xe2\x80\x94pushes brawn over brain.' b'The Creation arrived just as the British Invasion shook off regimented R&B influences, then they departed just as rock started to get deeper and weirder. Certainly, a band that was pushing wailing organs and keening guitars could\xe2\x80\x99ve survived the prog rock era, but that early lack of success pushed the band into a series of personnel upheavals, eventually dooming the band. Yet, their brief, blazing life is also why they remain captivating: they lived minute to minute, pushing out their best ideas because it was likely they\xe2\x80\x99d never survive to another seven inch.

b'Various Artists',7.4,"b'Ron Trent Presents - Prescription: Word, Sound & Power'",0,,b'March 18 2017',"b'Few have taken house music deeper than Ron Trent and his Prescription label, and this new comp gives a moody, silvery snapshot of the label\xe2\x80\x99s mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s heyday.'","b'We\xe2\x80\x99re five or 10 years into the latest deep house revival, 30-odd years since the style first coalesced. Yet in all that time, no one has come up with a precise definition of the style. Deep house is less a set of characteristics as it is a kind of blue, a mood recognizable primarily for its woozy, immersive pull. If house music\xe2\x80\x99s steady thump is the anchor, then everything else\xe2\x80\x94synths, bassline, vocals, effects\xe2\x80\x94tosses to and fro like kelp in the current.' b'Few have taken house music deeper than Ron Trent and his Prescription label, which he co-founded with Chez Damier in 1993. *Ron Trent Presents \xe2\x80\x93 Prescription: Word, Sound & Power *is a snapshot of the label\xe2\x80\x99s mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s heyday, when Prescription developed an instantly recognizable sound rooted in the jacking grooves of early Chicago house, splashed with moody tone color, and crosscut with Afro-Latin polyrhythms. The compilation\xe2\x80\x99s 24 tracks\xe2\x80\x94nearly all by Trent, either solo or in collaboration with artists like Damier and Anthony Nicholson\xe2\x80\x94highlight Prescription\xe2\x80\x99s sweet spot: not too rough, not too slick, and swirled with dusky color.' b'Unlike Trent\xe2\x80\x99s early hit \xe2\x80\x9cAltered States\xe2\x80\x9d and its larger-than-life hook, these tracks tend to conceal more than they reveal. There are few obvious melodies; instead, sounds painted on in overlapping layers create the illusion of unfathomable depth. Trent has described his style at the time as \xe2\x80\x9cdrum-orientated Chicago rhythm tracks with a minimalistic melody,\xe2\x80\x9d and the key word there is tracks: Unlike songs, these tumbling perpetual-motion machines have no verses or choruses, no bridges, no reprises. They roll straight ahead in an unswerving line, climbing upward at a steady, 30-degree grade until, some imperceptible climax having been reached, they begin their descent, shedding layers as they lose elevation. But such simple additive and subtractive arrangements don\xe2\x80\x99t account for the complex ways in which those moving parts interact. Three or four drum patterns\xe2\x80\x94machine sequences, disco breaks, cowbells, congas\xe2\x80\x94might run in parallel at any given moment, each with its own particular sense of swing and syncopation. Similarly, what might sound at first like a single set of chords reveals itself to be four or five different layers of synthesizer, organ, Rhodes, and sampled voice, all fused into one rippling wave.' b'Chez-N Trent\xe2\x80\x99s anthemic \xe2\x80\x9cThe Choice\xe2\x80\x9d is the only selection that grabs you by the lapels, but its charm lies in the details: rimshots so vivid you can practically feel the grain on the sticks; a wheezy ghost rhythm of sampled grunts and hiccups. Trent\xe2\x80\x99s 13-minute \xe2\x80\x9cSeduction\xe2\x80\x9d strikes an impeccable balance between atmosphere and sheer muscle: Shakers and syncopated bassline keep pushing things forward, even as deep blue chords apply a narcotic sense of drag. At their best, Trent\xe2\x80\x99s tunes throw up the faintest hint of a silvery hook, just enough to draw you deeper into their tidal flux.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s very best track is its first: \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Factory,\xe2\x80\x9d which Trent and Damier made in their Detroit studio following the 10-hour drive home from New York, where they\xe2\x80\x99d gone to see Junior Vasquez spin at the Sound Factory. Inspired by the clarity of the club\xe2\x80\x99s sound system and the energy on the dancefloor, the tune samples Kerri Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s *Atmosphere\xc2\xa0*EP, a 12-inch they\xe2\x80\x99d picked up on their trip to the city. Even though the link is clear\xe2\x80\x94those aquamarine chords are a dead giveaway\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMorning Factory\xe2\x80\x9d ultimately sounds nothing like its source material. Where Chandler\xe2\x80\x99s tune is crisp and clearly defined, \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Factory\xe2\x80\x9d is a soft and spongy, with shakers, bells, and synths dubbed into a vaporous haze. Atmosphere was, at the time, about as deep as deep house got. But with \xe2\x80\x9cMorning Factory,\xe2\x80\x9d Trent and Damier blew the dimensions of the style wide open. Today, anyone traversing the outer limits of deep house still follows in their wake.'"

Perhaps songwriters Bill Lennox and Bobby Colombo, bassist Joshua Brooks, and drummer Jake Kmiecik\xe2\x80\x99s time in local acts like Tyvek and Growwing Pains are to attribute for the streamlining of genres, though even that passes off the kismet their sound stirs up.' b'Bonny Doon recline deep in the kind of folk music that gives off its own warmth, where a drunken evening filled with texts from his mom on \xe2\x80\x9cI See You\xe2\x80\x9d offers a laugh or the confident piano chords in \xe2\x80\x9cEvening All Day Long\xe2\x80\x9d suggest resilience. But underneath their blues-tinged instrumentals is abject loneliness. \xe2\x80\x9c(Crowded)\xe2\x80\x9d is five minutes of Neil Young-style apathy. \xe2\x80\x9cRelieved\xe2\x80\x9d channels Smog and Kurt Vile shrugs. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Time Is It in Portland?\xe2\x80\x9d sees Colombo\xc2\xa0pining after a lost love, detailing friendships he let dissolve and a willful ignorance of how to fix it all. Like any successful singer, he\xe2\x80\x99s introspective even when he sings like there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in carrying on.' b'A sliver of their punk roots slip into Bonny Doon to give their beezy country some rock bite, though it varies in form. There\xe2\x80\x99s cuts like \xe2\x80\x9cSummertime Friends,\xe2\x80\x9d where half-spoken lyrics about mindless relationships recall the deadpan delivery of Parquet Courts. Elsewhere are distorted guitar chases speeding alongside lively drumming, like on \xe2\x80\x9cLost My Way.\xe2\x80\x9d So when a song like \xe2\x80\x9cNever Been to California\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which employs a honky-tonk bass part and shaky organ\xe2\x80\x94plays, the tone change feels like a payoff instead of a downshift.' b""Their best mode is when Bonny Doon take a step back, brush their hands, and accept a role as an observer. The only way to counter a crumbling world with their surroundings moving at full tilt is to create stability. Much of this tone comes from the album\xe2\x80\x99s construction: each member passed the songs around to flesh out instrumentals. Part of Bonny Doon was recorded in Russell Industrial Center, one of the\xc2\xa0city\xe2\x80\x99s biggest arts redevelopment projects, and over the three years it took to release the full-length, outsiders snatched up cheap real estate across the city, placing capitalism's ethics at the forefront of their minds. Bonny Doon aren\xe2\x80\x99t singing about Detroit specifically, but they bear witness to the city\xe2\x80\x99s evolution\xe2\x80\x94or lack thereof\xe2\x80\x94whether they want to or not, and the ways in which it sours their mood is evident. When Lennox\xc2\xa0sings \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right/Yeah, I gotta grow up,\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cYou Can\xe2\x80\x99t Hide,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s not charged with motivation or promise. It\xe2\x80\x99s empty. He agrees to change but the energy to do so was long ago stripped, hence why he sees himself reflected in the bottom of a wine bottle and fading neon signs.\xc2\xa0They know change will happen, but they also know they have so little to do with the course it takes. Why not watch the madness unfold and shrug its worst parts off?"" b'That hopeless undertone to their otherwise easygoing country rock gives them a distinguished voice. Should they continue to hone it, they can carve their own distinctions, stepping away from the Bill Callahan and David Berman similarities to become an RIYL descriptor themselves. An album of sunlit melodies with the shadows of Detroit looming over it delivers more than expected; it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy creating a doleful aftertaste that never quite dampens spirits, but Bonny Doon pull it off. By the time that complexity in their songwriting reveals itself, you\xe2\x80\x99re already on the next listen, fully aware of humanity\xe2\x80\x99s cessation and the band\xe2\x80\x99s decision to cozy up on the porch to watch. Nothing articulates the warmth of their nonchalant despair like the line: \xe2\x80\x9cI was staring at the setting sun and I realized my time had run out/And I was relieved.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe we should be doing the same.'"
b'ANOHNI',7.7,b'Paradise EP',0,b'Experimental',b'March 17 2017',"b""As a musical companion EP to 2016's\xc2\xa0HOPELESSNES, Anohni makes explicit the connections between gender and ecocide, and asks herself and her audience to recognize complicity and take action.""","b'In May 2016, just a few weeks after releasing her powerful record HOPELESSNESS, Anohni\xc2\xa0debuted an accompanying live performance at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Park Avenue Armory. The cavernous drill hall amplified her\xc2\xa0thunderous production to prophetic heights, but the presentation was less a showcase of artistry than it was a persuasive address. Anohni\xc2\xa0herself stood shrouded in a veiled habit beneath a towering screen that showed an assortment of women mouthing along to her songs. Never once was she, nor her collaborators Daniel Lopatin, aka Oneohtrix Point Never, and Christopher Elms, the center of attention. The point was clear: the words coming out of her mouth are so universal and enduring that they are greater than one individual.' b'Nine of the artists, poets, and activists featured in the Armory show reappear on the cover of Anohni\xe2\x80\x99s newest seven-song EP, Paradise. They are shown weeping, drenched in blood, faces weary with pain. These are the people whose concerns Anohni works to vocalize, those who understand that womanhood and the Earth from which we subsist are deeply intertwined. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly an intervention by women around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Anohni writes in an accompanying piece, \xe2\x80\x9cWith their innate knowledge of interdependency, deep listening, empathy, and self-sacrifice, could possibly alter our species\xe2\x80\x99 desperate course.\xe2\x80\x9d The singer has spoken extensively about gender and ecocide as a member of the Future Feminism collective, but never before has she been so explicit about their cause-and-effect relationship. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother\xe2\x80\x99s love/Her gentle touch/My father\xe2\x80\x99s hand/Rest on my throat,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings on the title track, contrasting the feminine Earth with those who wish her harm. More than simply tossing around blame on Paradise, Anohni takes responsibility herself and urges her audience to do so as well.' b'Once again reunited with her production crew of Lopatin and Hudson Mohawke, Paradise comes off as a HOPELESSNESS companion piece rather than a stand-alone album. Even as her music grows increasingly industrial, the organic remains a constant presence, a subtle reminder that we carry the earth within us. Like a biodome filled with an assortment of ecosystems, Paradise jumps from rocky and volcanic to chirping and tropical with just the slightest change of beat, while each\xc2\xa0song sticks closely to its appointed terrain. On the furious title track, skittering percussion and booming production support Anohni as she describes apocalyptic loss and turmoil. \xe2\x80\x9cStaring at myself/I feel giant and trapped/Seemingly/Without escape,\xe2\x80\x9d she observes, inferring that the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s destruction incites mortal dysmorphia. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here, not here.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The abrasive \xe2\x80\x9cJesus Will Kill You\xe2\x80\x9d picks up where HOPELESSNESS\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cObama\xe2\x80\x9d left off, a mournful interrogation of those who use their power to destroy the earth and its inhabitants. \xe2\x80\x9cRicochet,\xe2\x80\x9d on the other hand, is a joyful, bouncing promise to \xe2\x80\x9ccurse\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chate\xe2\x80\x9d the creator for the state of existence.\xc2\xa0Both songs\xe2\x80\x99 invocation of a punitive deity may seem sudden since Anohni tends to explore corporeal matters rather than the spiritual. But in the year since HOPELESSNESS, her rage and pain have transcended human action.' b'The final track, \xe2\x80\x9cShe Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Mourn Her Loss,\xe2\x80\x9d also closed out the Armory show and was the most powerful moment of the evening. The song itself is a pleading ballad about how the Earth holds her tears and simply accepts change. \xe2\x80\x9cWho will remember her? If not her children,\xe2\x80\x9d Anohni asks. As it was at the Armory, the rhetorical question is again raised by a speech Aboriginal artist Ngalangka Nola Taylor originally presented at the World Economic Forum. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are wondering what is happening to the world. Everything is change, changing,\xe2\x80\x9d she asks in broken English. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are we going to stop and work on it and work together and make the world a better place to live for all of us?\xe2\x80\x9d Anohni provided one solution just days before the release of Paradise.' b'She revealed on Facebook that the EP contains a seventh bonus track called \xe2\x80\x9cI Never Stopped Loving You\xe2\x80\x9d that is available for a small price: \xe2\x80\x9ca gesture of anonymous vulnerability\xe2\x80\x9d communicated over email. By asking her audience to connect intimately in exchange for a piece of herself, Anohni presents a reminder that there is a human behind the materials we consume, just like there is an Earth from which we were born and from which we harm without thought. *Paradise challenges its listeners to emotionally engage with their surroundings in hopes that they develop a conscious understanding that there are consequences to our daily conveniences. *As Anohni continues her resistance, she recognizes the battle is impossible to win without an open heart.'"

On the band\xe2\x80\x99s self-titled 2014 debut, which was recorded in one of the many city basements that grew them, they never showed their full hand. Four\xc2\xa0of its nine tracks were a single hook of eight or nine words\xc2\xa0and almost nothing else. Jason Balla\xe2\x80\x99s guitar lines featured plenty of space between each note, and they\xc2\xa0honk, nasal and\xc2\xa0blaring,\xc2\xa0as if their garage indie rock was designed with the express purpose of forcing their way through to the back of an overcrowded basement. The band learned quickly that their overflowing energy is best spent when pouring more into less, and not vice versa.' b""Offers\xc2\xa0is NE-HI\xe2\x80\x99s second album and first on Grand Jury Music, and it reintroduces the band as one who plays\xc2\xa0above-ground. Coming off of multiple tours where they regularly played on proper stages for the first time, NE-HI built these songs accordingly: They sound twice as developed. The co-frontman platoon of Mikey Wells, the more verse-chorus-minded songwriter, and Balla, who on stage assumes the form of a rubber band in flight, dial up the energy between the two. Their ballooning sound is a close approximation of the NE-HI live show*\xe2\x80\x94the band's best foot forward\xe2\x80\x94*and captures the breath\xc2\xa0of the band up close like being inches away from their mics in a moldy basement."" b'On the Wells-led highlights \xe2\x80\x9cBuried on the Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSisters,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Wanna Know You,\xe2\x80\x9d Balla\xe2\x80\x99s guitar buzzes and swerves behind him, forming these hardly logical interactions that make for\xc2\xa0Offers\xe2\x80\x99s most interesting moments. The album\xe2\x80\x99s first single, \xe2\x80\x9cDrag,\xe2\x80\x9d is also the best bridge between basement- and stage-NE-HI, featuring a full structure without sacrificing the shouts. The abrasive instrumental breakdowns that NE-HI leaned on for their loudest early songs aren\xe2\x80\x99t common here, but the one that shows up on \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOut of Reach\xe2\x80\x9d punctuates one of the least ambiguous lyrics Balla has written: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to get along?/Say the word, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you right in.\xe2\x80\x9d Neither singer is one to get cheated on a single vowel sound.' b'Offers\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0completed on its second studio go-around after the first was scrapped almost entirely. The pressure to deliver\xe2\x80\x94and to fold into the business of building a successful band\xe2\x80\x94seems to have found its way into the songs, which can flirt a little too closely with self-obsession. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery Dent\xe2\x80\x9d reckons with all the glad-handing required to get ahead in the business, and on \xe2\x80\x9cBuried on the Moon,\xe2\x80\x9d Wells takes an even more cynical look at the process: \xe2\x80\x9cWell come on make a record like your dear old dad/Yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you all the money then make you feel sad.\xe2\x80\x9d The shoegazing title track looks upon the defeat of a missed opportunity with dread: \xe2\x80\x9cOffer\xe2\x80\x99s gone/No response/I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on too long,\xe2\x80\x9d Balla sings, exhaustingly.' b'But\xc2\xa0Offers\xc2\xa0deliberately ends on a more optimistic ode to their roots, a song that feels like NE-HI\xe2\x80\x99s home base. On \xe2\x80\x9cStay Young,\xe2\x80\x9d they talk changing, growing, and resisting age\xe2\x80\x94while all too self-aware of the embarrassment of admitting to resisting age. \xe2\x80\x9cTime gets away from you / And it\xe2\x80\x99s not coming back,\xe2\x80\x9d Balla sings.

The chops are there, but the broader point is less clear.'","b'Squarepusher\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Jenkinson is not a man prone to inertia. Since his breakout in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s with the frenetic avant drum\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99bass of Feed Me Weird Things and Hard Normal Daddy, his career has assumed a sort of pinball trajectory, bouncing\xc2\xa0from prettified electroacoustic music to solo bass noodling to a period spent composing for a robotic band (see 2014 EP Music for Robots), clinging to instrumental virtuosity as a guiding precept. In this respect, the live-band project Shobaleader One is simultaneously a clean break and business as usual, being both the start of a new phase and the point at which a few older ideas fully germinate.' b'The Shobaleader One concept came to life in 2010, with an album titled Squarepusher Presents Shobaleader One: d\xe2\x80\x99Demonstrator. Incorporating elements of R&B, heavy metal, and Jenkinson\xe2\x80\x99s own treated vocals, it purported to be the work of a live band, but was probably just the work of Jenkinson himself. But d\xe2\x80\x99Demonstrator did attract some fellow travelers, and early in 2016, Shobaleader One emerged as a genuine touring entity\xe2\x80\x94Jenkinson on bass, plus three musicians going by the names Strobe Nazard, Company Laser, and Arg Nution, taking on keyboards, drums, and guitar, respectively. At their gigs, this \xe2\x80\x9cspace-pop\xe2\x80\x9d quartet set about reworking a number of Squarepusher standards through the medium of hyperspeed jazz-funk, their identities concealed by masks that look like malfunctioning Tenori-on.' b'While not explicitly presented as a live album, Elektrac seems to be taken in part\xc2\xa0from concert\xc2\xa0recordings, though\xc2\xa0were it not for the light applause that punctuates each track you might not notice. The recordings are crystal-clear, and there is no doubting the chops of the band themselves, who handle their task with virtuoso ease. Some tracks here feel well suited to a Shobaleader overhaul. A sprint through \xe2\x80\x9cCoopers World\xe2\x80\x9d from 1997\xe2\x80\x99s Hard Normal Daddy imagines it as the score to some hardboiled \xe2\x80\x9970s cop-drama, all sticky wah-wah guitar and limber-fingered keyboard runs. \xe2\x80\x9cE8 Boogie\xe2\x80\x9d is pretty much a showcase for Jenkinson\xe2\x80\x99s genuinely startling warp-speed bass plucking. Elsewhere, there\xe2\x80\x99s some entertainment\xc2\xa0in watching the outfit stretch to cover distant corners of Squarepusher\xe2\x80\x99s artistic mien. Company Laser nearly blows a circuit trying to replicate the drill\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99bass flurries of \xe2\x80\x9cJourney to Reedham,\xe2\x80\x9d while the ensemble show impressive restraint on a blissfully centered take on \xe2\x80\x9cIambic 5 Poetry,\xe2\x80\x9d the pretty, vibes-laden standout from 1999\xe2\x80\x99s Budakhan Mindphone.' b'These enjoyable moments are balanced by stretches where you realize you\xe2\x80\x99re not so much enjoying Elektrac as being subjected to it. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Go Plastic\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSquarepusher Theme\xe2\x80\x9d solo interminably, while a mid-album turn towards the heavy turns out low points like \xe2\x80\x9cMegazine\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Daft Punk gone metal gone wrong\xe2\x80\x94and a rather cold and lifeless technical riffer called \xe2\x80\x9cDelta-V.\xe2\x80\x9d Jenkinson has explained he wants Shobaleader One to sound like \xe2\x80\x9can insane band.\xe2\x80\x9d But nothing here verges on the elemental extremity or deranged humor displayed by earlier groups fusing jazz and metal\xe2\x80\x94Lightning Bolt, for instance, or John Zorn\xe2\x80\x99s Naked City. Instead, these tracks balance loudness with a rather fussy and joyless quality; fun to play, probably, not so much to listen to.' b'In a 2016 interview with Q magazine, Jenkinson described Shobaleader One as a reaction to the current state of electronic music production. \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware companies, partly in order to further their business aims, have made it so easy to make electronic music that the format in general is beginning to assume a troubling air of painting-by-numbers pointlessness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Look closer at Shobaleader\xe2\x80\x99s gleaming metal carapace\xe2\x80\x94can you see the jazz snob poking through? The idea that an album of finicky jazz-funk covers is the answer to anything in 2017 is a little rich. But more broadly, I\xe2\x80\x99d say Jenkinson\xe2\x80\x99s assessment is flawed. The increasing availability of production software has enabled the rise of music-makers otherwise marginalized for geographic or economic reasons\xe2\x80\x94think localized sounds like grime, or gqom, or, if you want to go back further, those early jungle productions that gave Squarepusher its initial impetus. As ever, it\xe2\x80\x99s not so much about the tools, but what you do with them. And while it\xe2\x80\x99s laudable that Jenkinson is always moving, never resting, Elektrac feels a bit of a sideshow: a flexing of technique with little to display but its own shiny spectacle.'"

He played with a sense of ecstatic lyricism in a band assembled by Merrill Garbus for the album w h o k i l l. He\xe2\x80\x99s delivered thoughtful supporting work in Battle Trance, a tenor-quartet group that plays compositions by Travis Laplante. And Nelson can also command center stage; his raging solos in Amirtha Kidambi\xe2\x80\x99s Elder Ones invite comparisons to some of experimental jazz\xe2\x80\x99s most admired reed extremists.' b'This kind of performance mobility doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tend to come about casually\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Nelson enjoys taking on discrete roles in different ensembles. On his first record as part of GRID, a collaborative trio with drummer Nick Podgurski and bassist Tim Dahl, Nelson conceives of a different challenge. This time, he often plays the saxophone covertly. As he puts his tones through a raft of pedals and electronics, the majority of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s licks sound like the work of a lead guitarist in an avant-rock trio.' b'On the band\xe2\x80\x99s eponymous\xc2\xa0debut, Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s indirect use of the saxophone is the most consistently thrilling element. During the initial minutes of the first movement (titled \xe2\x80\x9c(+/+)\xe2\x80\x9d), you might spend some time re-checking the album credits just to make sure there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a guest guitarist on hand. But those slow-moving, feedbacking melodies are all Nelson. The free-improv pulses from the rhythm section create a compelling, abstract background. And when Nelson allows small bulbs of typical reed-instrument noise to flower, in the fourth minute, the listener gains a greater appreciation of the saxophonist\xe2\x80\x99s command over this unusual terrain.' b'The NNA Tapes label has used the term \xe2\x80\x9cdoom jazz\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the band\xe2\x80\x99s sound, though there are some precedents that predate this\xc2\xa0subgenre coinage. Starting in\xc2\xa0the \xe2\x80\x9990s, Rashied Ali\xe2\x80\x94the ferocious, late-period drummer for John Coltrane\xe2\x80\x94worked with bassist Bill Laswell and the guitarist-vocalist Keiji Haino in the outfit Purple Trap. And Laswell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9980s partnership with saxophonist Peter Br\xc3\xb6tzmann, in the group Last Exit and on the duo album Low Life, is another touchstone for this school of noise-jazz. But those past ensembles have often been at pains to show how many song forms they can undermine: swinging wildly between clattering ragers, ambient soundscapes, and even some dance textures.' b'The members of GRID take a more stable view of the style. Some passages on the album have slightly more propulsive drive (see: \xe2\x80\x9c(-/+)\xe2\x80\x9d). Others a shade of greater mystery (as on \xe2\x80\x9c(-/-)\xe2\x80\x9d). But over four movements spanning 38 minutes, the differences between these sections are not as stark as on many prior rock-meets-free-jazz outings. The benefit of this more even-keeled approach is its novelty. Though the textures are extreme in nature, and densely layered, GRID doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem primarily interested in bludgeoning listeners.' b'That decision results in an unusually dreamy realization of the underlying aesthetic: one that brings the group\xe2\x80\x99s work more in line with drone composition than with that of Laswell. The risk\xc2\xa0stalking\xc2\xa0such a choice is the fact that\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0listener\xe2\x80\x99s attention can drift a bit. But in electing not to close with a dramatic bash of a finale, the members of this gifted trio signal that they may be fine with that reaction. Like much else on this surprising set, the quick fade-out ending creates an idiosyncratic impact that lingers well beyond the album\xe2\x80\x99s running time.'"
b'Spoon',7.4,b'Hot Thoughts',0,b'Rock',b'March 16 2017',"b'Spoon stay in their well-earned lane but tweak the formula just enough on their ninth album, keeping their reliably great songwriting and adding new, electronic textures.'","b'Despite remaining perennial indie rock favorites over the last decade, Spoon have always been about that small-stakes life. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to alter the course of your existence\xe2\x80\x94frontman Britt Daniel would probably smirk at such a claim\xe2\x80\x94but occasionally Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-specific details will creep into your mind unexpectedly. Is Dorian\xe2\x80\x99s a real place? What\xe2\x80\x99s the corner by Sound Exchange in Austin look like anyway? And why don\xe2\x80\x99t more people talk about how much *Garden State *actually sucked?' b'This is not to say that Spoon\xe2\x80\x99s songs don\xe2\x80\x99t often overflow with sound, as they increasingly have. But there is no tortured myth surrounding the whole ordeal, no idealistic aims to be anything more than career band making themselves happy. Every few years, they put out a record that sounds like Spoon but offers some new little twist, they tour for long stretches after that, and then they go away for a while. Their last album, 2014\xe2\x80\x99s They Want My Soul, was one of their best\xe2\x80\x94soulful and swirling, with just enough teeth showing between the hooks. Their ninth album, Hot Thoughts, picks up that thread and takes it in a funkier and freer direction. There are loads of drum beats that sound indebted to hip-hop and dance music throughout, downbeat electronics, and two five-minute instrumentals, including a moody jazz coda that closes the record.' b'But Spoon also know their lane quite well: punchy, inconspicuously catchy songs, with choruses just vague enough to make them applicable outside of whatever stylized vignette Daniel has yelped out; bonus points if there\xe2\x80\x99s a brief jam session that runs intoxicatingly off the rails for just a moment towards the song\xe2\x80\x99s end. This dichotomy can make *Hot Thoughts *a little uneven, unsure if it\xe2\x80\x99s trying to be arty or poppy while playing around with the drum machines.' b'There are the hit attempts: The repetitive title track, whose jittery energy is practically killed by its surface-level \xe2\x80\x9chot thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d about a sexy girl, nary a hint of clever winking to be found. And there are the clear hits: \xe2\x80\x9cCan I Sit Next to You,\xe2\x80\x9d which proves they\xe2\x80\x99re almost as adept as Phoenix at infectiously anxious dance-rock, and \xe2\x80\x9cDo I Have to Talk You Into It,\xe2\x80\x9d an instant classic that could only come from this band. Jim Eno\xe2\x80\x99s swaggering drums\xe2\x80\x94a key element of Spoon\xe2\x80\x99s sound since the start\xe2\x80\x94and Alex Fischel\xe2\x80\x99s descending piano chords drive the song boundlessly forward, punctuated by Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s selective rasp. It takes a certain kind of 45-year-old frontman to sing the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cknock knock\xe2\x80\x9d and still sound at least moderately cool, not like some phony in his first pair of Ray-Bans.' b'Eno and Fischel also shine on \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Caress,\xe2\x80\x9d a toe-tapping tune about one of those ghosts that linger in Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s head. He shoehorns in one of his Britticisms, a dry parenthetical that somehow captures the whole life of a character: \xe2\x80\x9cCoconut milk, coconut water/You still like to tell me they\xe2\x80\x99re the same/And who am I to say?\xe2\x80\x9d On \xe2\x80\x9cPink Up\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbles about taking a train to Marrakesh while the production\xe2\x80\x94via indie-psych go-to Dave Fridmann\xe2\x80\x94grows hazy and primal. By the end, the looping piano line, eerie strings, and bleeps of gibberish leave Spoon sounding a little like Radiohead. If anything, \xe2\x80\x9cPink Up\xe2\x80\x9d tees up the final track, \xe2\x80\x9cUs,\xe2\x80\x9d which returns to the same motif after dark via saxophone and bells.' b'All this is a far cry from the band who wrote clever little classic-rock paeans to their fathers\xe2\x80\x99 fitted shirts, but even then they were throwing in touches of harpsichord. That\xe2\x80\x99s the trick with Spoon: They make it seem more straightforward than it actually is. Over time, their slowly accumulated sonic excess has led them here, to what could be considered their electronic album. But they\xe2\x80\x99re caught just slightly between who they used to be and where they\xe2\x80\x99re going, and the songs don\xe2\x80\x99t always find a musical common ground. There\xe2\x80\x99s one point in particular where their maximalism serves their attempt at an anthem\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cTear It Down\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but what\xe2\x80\x99s funny is that the song\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping *whoa-oh *climax is reminiscent of Arcade Fire, not Spoon.\xc2\xa0The tinkering of the trim Spoon attitude has become the most engaging part of their latter-day career. For a band that seems built on a reliable formula, they remain full of possibilities.'"
b'Your Old Droog',7.7,b'Packs',0,b'Rap',b'March 16 2017',"b""Featuring Heems, Danny Brown, and Wiki, the young New York MC 's first official album feels like a graduation, with bars and beats that feel both fresh and lived-in.""","b'In June of 2014, a rapper by the name of Your Old Droog uploaded an eponymous 10-track EP to Soundcloud. Intentionally mysterious, with no photos, videos, or any identifying information, it quickly generated buzz in the rap nerd blogosphere. When he \xe2\x80\x9ccame out,\xe2\x80\x9d he did it in a profile in The New Yorker, and when he sold out the Studio at Webster Hall for his first-ever show, it got written up in The New York Times.' b'So what powered the hype machine? It\xe2\x80\x99s quite simple, really: Your Old Droog sounds a lot like Nas. At times, his fine sandpaper growl sounds similar enough to be unsettling. And before he revealed himself to The New Yorker, plenty of people were convinced that the 20-something Ukrainian immigrant from Coney Island actually was Nas. Once your brain makes the connection, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to disassociate, even if the content of his lyrics (self-deprecating cornball humor) and favorite poetic device (punchlines laden with pop-culture references) don\xe2\x80\x99t resemble anything that Nas has released in the last 20 years. But it\xe2\x80\x99s ever-looming, especially for anyone intimately familiar with the Illmatic one\xe2\x80\x99s oeuvre.' b""In the years that followed, Droog dropped a couple EPs (the rock-obsessed Kinison and The Nicest) and a collaborative project with Wiki,\xc2\xa0What Happened to Fire? But as the first collection of songs in his short career packaged and marketed as an \xe2\x80\x9calbum,\xe2\x80\x9d his latest LP Packs feels like a graduation as it connects verses and beats from various collaborators to make a coherent statement. He taps comedian Anthony Jeselnik to provide radio-style interludes throughout; his dry, sardonic wit cements the generally absurdist tone of the LP. And while he\xe2\x80\x99s stacked the deck with features\xe2\x80\x94Heems, Danny Brown, Wiki, Edan, and Chris Crack all contribute verses\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s never overshadowed. No one would've ever confused Your Old Droog with Nas if the bars weren\xe2\x80\x99t hard."" b'Packs uses beats from a handful of producers\xe2\x80\x94RTNC, 88-Keys, Edan, the Alchemist, and ID Labs\xe2\x80\x99 E. Dan.\xe2\x80\x94but the palette of sounds is relatively minimal. On the standout track \xe2\x80\x9cBangladesh,\xe2\x80\x9d Droog and RTNC freak an ill Bansuri loop over a simple boom-bap drum beat. Most of the productions are sparse, but colored by thoughtful flourishes: Harp strings, record scratches, distorted vocals and explosions, even a Frank Zappa sample, removed from the context of his posthumous bizarro opus Civilization Phaze III. He\xe2\x80\x99s riding a nostalgic sonic wave currently being surfed by NYC contemporaries Roc Marciano, Action Bronson, and Joey Bada$$, rappers doing their best to embody the spirit of New York hip-hop without getting stuck in its past.\xc2\xa0And if there\xe2\x80\x99s any underlying ethos of the city\xe2\x80\x99s hip-hop scene, it\xe2\x80\x99s the merit-based hierarchy that rewards lyrical skill above nearly all else, whether it be sex appeal, skin color, or \xe2\x80\x9cgangsta\xe2\x80\x9d status. The beats always take a backseat to the bars.' b'Droog\xe2\x80\x99s punchline-driven style evokes the vicious jabs wielded by Big L, were he less concerned with trapping and more into watching \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s wholly unafraid to be corny; On \xe2\x80\x9cRapman\xe2\x80\x9d he plays the part of \xe2\x80\x9ca hero with a cape and a mixtape\xe2\x80\x9d with a straight face, earnestly out to save the rap game from whack rappers. \xe2\x80\x9cYo I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of sycophants who want to make their idols proud,\xe2\x80\x9d he declares. \xe2\x80\x9cI want my hero to hear me and shit his pants.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'But much like his buddy Wiki, Droog venerates the art of rap storytelling, weaving colorful street tales of hood characters that make up his perspective of New York City. Each of the three verses on \xe2\x80\x9cYou Can Do It! (Give Up)\xe2\x80\x9d tells instantly recognizable stories of people with failed dreams of stardom: The hoop dreamer, the washed up model/actress, the struggle rapper. His tone is dry but empathetic, the hook evincing a perpetual motivational struggle, the drive to succeed (\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do it!\xe2\x80\x9d) competing with self-defeating loathing (\xe2\x80\x9cGive up!\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'And of all the characters in Droog\xe2\x80\x99s raps, New York looms the largest. His rhymes are full of borough references (Funkmaster Flex night, nubuck Timberlands, bodega loosies), and while he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t front as a gangster, he\xe2\x80\x99s unquestionably hood; when his first EP dropped in 2014 he told Rolling Stone\xc2\xa0he paid for the studio sessions with winnings from playing cee-lo. Packs\xc2\xa0is a record by, of, and for New York City, espousing the romantic notion it will never change, no matter how much the world does.'"
b'Sarah Davachi',7.3,b'All My Circles Run',0,b'Electronic',b'March 16 2017',b'Ambient composer Sarah Davachi departs from her usual mix of instruments and electronics on an album that (mostly) focuses on the sound of single instruments.',"b'The ambient music that Sarah Davachi makes is profoundly thermal. Thick and sonorous, it pushes\xc2\xa0up, welling up from silence, weaving harmoniums, string instruments, and electronics\xc2\xa0together in ways that feel indivisible, if not eternal. And even where her recordings bring slightly different pressures to bear\xe2\x80\x94the soft, rippling\xc2\xa0Barons Court, the sloshy, church-organ languor of\xc2\xa0Dominions\xe2\x80\x94the overall effect is similar: a benign hypnosis, the will to dissipate, a gentle weightlessness. To succumb to any entry in the Vancouver composer\xe2\x80\x99s growing discography is to wade idly into the surf at low tide, only to suddenly find yourself 15\xc2\xa0yards away from the shore.' b'Synthesizers\xe2\x80\x94Rolands, Buchlas, EMSs\xe2\x80\x94have been integral to Davachi\xe2\x80\x99s sound since\xc2\xa0The Untuning of the Sky, her 2013 debut. Now, in an aesthetic dare worthy of two successive flips of an Oblique Strategies card,\xc2\xa0All My Circles Run\xc2\xa0goes synth-free, with each of its five tracks (largely) centered on a separate instrument.' b""Circularity is embraced wholeheartedly here. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Voice\xe2\x80\x9d swirls an angelic multi-track chorus\xc2\xa0into a gorgeously smothering aria, as vocal iterations seize, then relinquish the foreground as if in a slow-motion round; the slow-drawn scrape that opens \xe2\x80\x9cFor Strings\xe2\x80\x9d yields to a braided, harmonized drone. After interlocking a frayed, reverberating series of guitar figures destined to disintegrate over time, \xe2\x80\x9cChanter\xe2\x80\x9d undercuts its own meditative drift with a two-note, interrogative counterpoint. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Piano\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94all aching, pecked tones, enervating whirr, and field-recorded backdrop pacing circuits\xe2\x80\x94recalls Sontag Shogun, a Brooklyn-based trio who commingle elements of classical and carefully-chosen samples into something mournfully beautiful. Even with the new focus,\xc2\xa0this version of Davachi isn't a fundamentally altered one\xe2\x80\x94her meditative warmth remains intact."" b""The real shift is one of artistic precision and a sense of amplification. Instead of viewing a passing scene out the window, we're looking now at the world through a microscope. That's especially true on \xe2\x80\x9cFor Organ,\xe2\x80\x9d the\xc2\xa0album\xe2\x80\x99s true centerpiece. Kneading and pitch-shifting wobbly, revolving tones until only a ringing, hypnotic din remains, the song seems to crack itself open and flood with brilliant melodic light; it brings to mind, ironically, Matmos\xe2\x80\x99 synth-opus Supreme Balloon. On that record, Matmos temporarily set aside conceptual pranks to embrace the synthesizer's possibilities; the result was music achingly beautiful and crystalline, winking just slightly. With Circles,\xc2\xa0an insidious, sublime gambit that pays off handsomely, Davachi\xe2\x80\x99s particular asceticism achieves a similar effect by pulling in an alternate direction. Like Brian Eno at his solo best, it's the sort of ambience that doesn't flood, that hovers precariously somewhere between the conscious and the unconscious, barely-there and indisputably present."""
b'Daym\xc3\xa9 Arocena',7.6,b'Cubafon\xc3\xada',0,b'Global',b'March 16 2017',"b'As an initiate of santer\xc3\xada, the Havana-born jazz singer is in tune with her religious and musical practices, as Cubafon\xc3\xada\xc2\xa0illuminates, pulling from genres within and adjacent to Cuban popular music.'","b'At the top of her brow, underneath her headwrap, Daym\xc3\xa9 Arocena wears a small feather. She\xe2\x80\x99d received a message once from a saint telling her that it would guide her so that she\xe2\x80\x99d never lose her way. As an initiate of santer\xc3\xada, or Regla de Ocha, the Havana-born jazz singer is well in tune with both her religious and musical practices, which are inextricably tied. In her latest project, *Cubafon\xc3\xada, *Arocena illuminates those ties, as well as those that connect different genres within and adjacent to Cuban popular music.' b'After her 2015 debut full-length, *Nueva Era, *and follow-up EP, One Takes, the now-24-year-old took some time to tour. Along the way, she came to realize just how much she missed home, which in turn inspired her sophomore album. Where on her first album, the songs are mostly jazz records with strong Afro-Cuban undercurrents, on Cubafon\xc3\xada, it often tilts the other way too, so that a track might be a rumba or a bolero, but with a distinctly jazz bent. She also makes it a point this time to work almost entirely with Cuban musicians. Leading them, she sounds more confident than ever. The result is a vibrant, bold record that is, at its heart, a love letter to her home country.' b""True to her roots, Arocena opens the album with a chant to Eleggua, the opener of roads. Otherworldly voices pierce through Ethiojazz-y horns, as she belts salutations to the orisha. Highlighting the influence of different African traditions in Cuban music, she follows up \xe2\x80\x9cEleggua,\xe2\x80\x9d which is Yoruba (or Lucum\xc3\xad), with a rumba, which combines various West and Central African musical traditions. \xe2\x80\x9cLa Rumba Me Llamo Yo\xe2\x80\x9d is a lively rumba guaguanc\xc3\xb3 that tells the story of a woman whose mother warns her of a man she doesn't want near her. It ends in an all-out party: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it you want them to give you?\xe2\x80\x9d the chorus asks in Spanish. \xe2\x80\x9cRumba, ven ven!\xe2\x80\x9d they answer. Daym\xc3\xa9, for her part, scats her way through a clatter of voices and percussion, coming out the other side unscathed and triumphant."" b'Perhaps unsurprisingly, her orisha is Yemay\xc3\xa1, goddess of the sea. Arocena\xe2\x80\x99s voice, like her laughter, is wide and enveloping. She sings with a warm rasp reminiscent of Buika (as on \xe2\x80\x9cLo Que Fue\xe2\x80\x9d), an emotional breadth that recalls Aretha, and an unwavering willingness to lay herself bare. In the first of a three-song run of ballads, \xe2\x80\x9cC\xc3\xb3mo\xe2\x80\x9d is a smooth, \xe2\x80\x9980s-inspired pop song that sits somewhere between Sade and Selena. In a hazy swirl of jazz saxophone, violin tremolo, and twinkling chimes, the artist laments (in Spanish), \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I live with my solitude? How do I begin this end?\xe2\x80\x9d The very next song over, \xe2\x80\x9cTodo Por Amor,\xe2\x80\x9d she is in love again\xe2\x80\x94wholly, fearlessly, maybe a little foolishly. \xe2\x80\x9cEres tu mi salvation, todo por tu amor,\xe2\x80\x9d she practically bleeds. The song is a bolero but with echoes of bachata, underscoring again the fluidity between different Afro-Caribbean music forms. Finally, on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x81ngel,\xe2\x80\x9d a slow, minimalist tango, Arocena\xe2\x80\x99s voice arcs and dips wordlessly, longing after something we cannot see.' b'As unafraid of pain or heartache as Daym\xc3\xa9 seems, so too is she unafraid of joy. \xe2\x80\x9cNegra Caridad\xe2\x80\x9d sounds like it could be the soundtrack to an old spaghetti western with elements of 1950s Benny Mor\xc3\xa9-era Cuban big band music and punchy vocals that recall La Lupe. Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cMambo Na\xe2\x80\x99 M\xc3\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d elides the spirit of mambo with New Orleans swing. Horns creak and chug; Daym\xc3\xa9 cranks her voice like a jack-in-the-box before crying, \xe2\x80\x9cMambo na\xe2\x80\x99 m\xc3\xa1!\xe2\x80\x9d Besides being a good time, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a reminder that Havana and New Orleans are colloquial sister cities with overlapping musical pasts and creole histories.' b'The album feels warm and full, thanks in part to the production. The texture changes, though, on the very last song\xe2\x80\x94the stripped down \xe2\x80\x9cValentine.\xe2\x80\x9d The track is a chang\xc3\xbc\xc3\xad, a folksy song from Guant\xc3\xa1namo, influenced by nearby Haiti. Over the scrape of a g\xc3\xbcira and a smattering of acoustic instruments (marimbula, tr\xc3\xa8s, clarinet), the daughter of Yemay\xc3\xa1 coos, \xe2\x80\x9cMon valentin, mi valentine, my valentine/In a moment, you gave freedom to my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d There is a sense of gratitude in her delivery\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps some relief\xe2\x80\x94to have wandered but finally returned to where her heart is freest, to her valentine, to Cuba.'"
b'Hurray for the Riff Raff',8.1,b'The Navigator',0,b'Rock',b'March 15 2017',"b""The band's sixth LP demands more seats at the table. It's a powerful folk concept album from a Nuyorican runaway who grew up obsessed with West Side Story before being liberated by Bikini Kill.""","b'Alynda Lee Segarra, the creative force behind Hurray for the Riff Raff, spent her formative years crisscrossing the country on greyhounds and freight trains. She climbed from the streets of New Orleans to the airwaves of NPR with a washboard and a banjo, a Horatio Alger narrative for the Americana set. Her last LP, Small Town Heroes, felt like a thesis presentation from a student of American folk music. She\xe2\x80\x99d spent years studying the form and its practitioners, a product of a community that helped lift her from street corners and coffee shops to international tours and a record contract. While searching for herself, she also imitated others, living inside classic folk, roots, and country songs while shaping her own powerful voice.' b""In that sense,\xc2\xa0The Navigator represents a departure\xe2\x80\x94she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t abandoned those sounds, rather she\xe2\x80\x99s graduated to something singular. It's roots music for the immigrant ID, a folk concept album from a Nuyorican runaway who grew up obsessed with West Side Story before being liberated by Bikini Kill. They lay bare the conceit in the album\xe2\x80\x99s Playbill-themed packaging: The songs are presented in two \xe2\x80\x9cActs\xe2\x80\x9d that\xc2\xa0follow her alter ego, a Puerto Rican street kid named Navita Milagros Negr\xc3\xb3n, who visits a bruja at the end of Act I looking for an escape from the oppressive confines of her city. When she wakes up from the bruja\xe2\x80\x99s spell at the start of Act II (40 years later), everything she knew is gone, and she begins to realize what she\xe2\x80\x99s lost."" b'Navi is a character, but she\xe2\x80\x99s also very much Segarra. She puts years of telling others\xe2\x80\x99 stories to work telling her own; in \xe2\x80\x9cLiving in the City,\xe2\x80\x9d she sets the scene for the first act, a snapshot of life in the PJs for a young girl. Navi brushes off casual harassment with a shrug, watches friends self-destruct with drug abuse, and sneaks into stairwells for fleeting moments of intimacy. The city is a thinly veiled but unnamed stand-in for New York, a city and culture Segarra fled from the day after she turned 17.' b'The Navigator is ostensibly a rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll record, but it expands Segarra\xe2\x80\x99s palette beyond the folk/country/blues lane she\xe2\x80\x99s thus far occupied. Her boozy, morning-after croon is still gorgeous, but now there\xe2\x80\x99s elements of Puerto Rican bomba and salsa, son cubano, doo-wop, and even the spoken-word poetry of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe she haunted as a teen. Her band has gone through a variety of lineups, but this one feels like a clean slate. Her longtime creative partners Sam Doores and Yosi Perlstein are nowhere to be seen\xe2\x80\x94in their place, she\xe2\x80\x99s recruited five\xc2\xa0hand percussionists, a trio of doo-wop backup singers, and Yva Las Vegass, a Venezuelan folkie from Brooklyn. She even samples the ghost of Pedro Pietri, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe co-founder whose \xe2\x80\x9cPuerto Rican Obituary\xe2\x80\x9d serves as a bridge between the two movements of her piano ballad showstopper, \xe2\x80\x9cPa\xe2\x80\x99lante.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'In the few moments when she strips away the beer-soaked barroom blues of \xe2\x80\x9cLife to Save\xe2\x80\x9d and the acoustic spiritual \xe2\x80\x9cHalfway There,\xe2\x80\x9d she almost sounds like her old self. But when the bongos break in on \xe2\x80\x9cRican Beach,\xe2\x80\x9d and she begins to list \xe2\x80\x9cour\xe2\x80\x9d things that \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x9d stole\xe2\x80\x94language, names, neighbors, streets\xe2\x80\x94 she\xe2\x80\x99s in a different place. Like many Latin-Americans, she\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in the middle, colored not just by her ancestors but the stimuli of the diaspora: The places she\xe2\x80\x99s seen, the people she\xe2\x80\x99s met, the music she\xe2\x80\x99s loved. The Navigator, which reclaims folk\xe2\x80\x99s protest roots and marries them to the sounds of the Caribbean, is a statement of that identity.' b""Segarra speaks to a broader reconciliation with the assimilation engrained in the American Dream, an acknowledgment of the limited perspective that comes with the white history taught in schools. She never learned Spanish and admits that for years she carried an inexplicable shame of her heritage.\xc2\xa0While writing this record, she pored through the Fania records back catalog, fell in love with the Puerto Rican poets Julia de Burgos and Pedro Pietri, and learned the history of the Young Lords and their newspaper, Pa\xe2\x80\x99lante. Like Navi, the city Segarra returned to after traversing the country was unrecognizable from the city she left\xe2\x80\x94the culture she once took for granted now fading away. When the \xe2\x80\x9cFourteen Floors\xe2\x80\x9d of her old project building come crashing down, she wistfully remembers her father\xe2\x80\x99s tales of the long journey from Puerto Rico, a haunting whisper of \xe2\x80\x9cit took a million years.\xe2\x80\x9d It's the universal dilemma of the displaced\xe2\x80\x94where do you go when you can\xe2\x80\x99t go home again?"" b'Segarra\xe2\x80\x99s first big foray into activism came with the feminist murder ballad \xe2\x80\x9cThe Body Electric,\xe2\x80\x9d the centerpiece of Small Town Heroes; she would later re-release her 2013 Trayvon Martin tribute \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody Knows\xe2\x80\x9d as part of the Our First 100 Days project. But the most declarative statement she\xe2\x80\x99s made yet came in the form of a scathing blog post admonishing the silence of her peers in the folk scene, near demanding that they use their art to join the struggle of their black and brown brothers and sisters whose bodies have been on the front lines of a civil rights movement that never really ended.' b'The Navigator\xe2\x80\x99s activist bent leans mostly towards systemic symptoms of colonization and gentrification, issues at the heart of both Navi and Segarra\xe2\x80\x99s story. If the call to arms of \xe2\x80\x9cPa\xe2\x80\x99lante\xe2\x80\x9d is the spiritual heart of the album, \xe2\x80\x9cRican Beach\xe2\x80\x9d is an angry protest, a condemnation of both the villainous and the apathetic: \xe2\x80\x9cNow all the politicians/They just squawk their mouths/They say \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll build a wall to keep them out\xe2\x80\x99/And all the poets were dying of a silence disease/So it happened quickly and with much ease.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'La gente del barrio has always had a voice, but too often it has been silenced. Not unlike Solange did on her stunning 2016 opus, Segarra uses The Navigator to demand more seats at the table for those voices that have always existed, but simply went unheard. And as she rallies the troops for the fight to come on \xe2\x80\x9cPa\xe2\x80\x99lante,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFrom El Barrio to Arecibo\xe2\x80\xa6from Marble Hill to the ghost of Emmett Till\xe2\x80\x9d she unites the struggle of all the survivors of white supremacy, and urges them onward, together.'"
b'Drexciya',7.6,b'Grava 4',0,b'Electronic',b'March 15 2017',"b'With their unvarnished style, the music of Detroit electronic duo Drexciya was proudly DIY. On their newly reissued 2002 album, they turned their attention from the sea towards the cosmos.'","b'Over the decade-long stretch between 1992-2002 that Gerald Donald and James Stinson released electronic music as Drexciya, water was a constant fixation. It was as if the ocean was a third member of the band. Their name described the group\xe2\x80\x99s vision of an underwater society built by the children of pregnant slaves thrown overboard during the Middle Passage. EPs and albums bore titles like Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s Lair, Hydro Doorways, and Digital Tsunami, and were littered with clues that outlined a byzantine afrofuturist mythology. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are only two wavejumpers in existence today,\xe2\x80\x9d they creepily intoned on 1995\xe2\x80\x99s riveting, white-knuckled \xe2\x80\x9cWavejumper,\xe2\x80\x9d positioning themselves as the last representatives of a lost tribe. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of things that come through water, all these different molecules\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s the way I see the music we do,\xe2\x80\x9d Stinson once said in a rare interview. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so endless.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Each of Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s records\xe2\x80\x94whether collaborating or going solo as Abstract Thought, Lab Rat XL, or Transllusion\xe2\x80\x94had deeply considered conceptual and philosophical premises. Thankfully, Drexciya were never too forthcoming, offering far more questions than answers. Their final album, 2002\xe2\x80\x99s newly-reissued Grava 4, continued to engage in this complex game of world building. It was originally released during a massively prolific 18-month period between 2001-2003, when the duo used various aliases to release seven albums, which they dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cstorms,\xe2\x80\x9d a set of tantalizingly disparate works that hinted at strange new developments in the Drexciyan fable.' b'Grava 4 is an album of stark, brooding introspection, alternately expansive and oblique. It sees Drexciya turning their attention towards the cosmos, as song titles shifted from aquatic themes to \xe2\x80\x9c700 Million Light Years From Earth,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDrexciyan Star Chamber,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAstronomical Guidepost.\xe2\x80\x9d A web of constellations was drawn on the cover. In the press surrounding Grava 4, the group claimed to have \xe2\x80\x9cfinally discovered Utopia (Drexciya Home Universe),\xe2\x80\x9d and they allegedly named a star after themselves on this website.' b'Opener \xe2\x80\x9cCascading Celestial Giants\xe2\x80\x9d casts a solemn, slow-motion tone. A churning rhythm sets a sluggish pace, while majestic choral pads suggest a reckoning with the infinite. (Close your eyes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine a pair of lonely travelers in a small spaceship drifting into the vast unknown.) This is followed up by the languid thrums of \xe2\x80\x9cPowers of the Deep,\xe2\x80\x9d which cruises at a melancholy clip and is ornamented with slithering, pinging effects. Though the group\xe2\x80\x99s rugged electro drum programming remains intact, everything else sits back in a moody reserve, trading their terrestrial aggressions for something more contemplative.' b'Throughout their career, Drexciya could be by turns nimble, slamming, or willfully obtuse. The one constant was their live chemistry in the studio. Their records feel proudly DIY, with a raw, unvarnished sheen and track structures that could confound all but the most dedicated DJs. While Grava 4 skips the two-minute pipe bombs of their earlier EPs, the arrangements maintain this proud humanity. The gradual congealing and playful dubbing of \xe2\x80\x9cDrexciyan Star Chamber\xe2\x80\x9d feels too spontaneous to be the work of careful computer programming, with a sense of discovery and frenetic focus giving life to its spacious funk. \xe2\x80\x9cGravity Waves,\xe2\x80\x9d meanwhile, has the tense, wiry urgency of a late-night jam.' b'Grava 4 is a grower, to be sure. There are no instant-classic, earworming anthems on the level of \xe2\x80\x9cAndreaen Sand Dunes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Sea\xe2\x80\x9d here (though the Kraftwerk-saluting \xe2\x80\x9c700 Million Light Years From Earth\xe2\x80\x9d comes close). Nor does the vulnerability Stinson showcased a year prior under the Other People Place moniker rub off on the duo. But Grava 4 opens up to those who give it space and attention.' b'Drexciya were pushing to the outer reaches of their sound on this album, and by the year\xe2\x80\x99s end, Stinson would pass from heart complications. In this context, their final deluge of material was perhaps an attempt to sum up the totality of their vision before time ran out. (Stinson had spent his last\xc2\xa0months in Georgia \xe2\x80\x9cfor health reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d and fans have interpreted his \xe2\x80\x9902 Transllusion title L.I.F.E. to stand for \xe2\x80\x9clife is fast ending.\xe2\x80\x9d) Album closer \xe2\x80\x9cAstronomical Guidepost\xe2\x80\x9d rides a bit of slippery funk, suggesting that space perhaps isn\xe2\x80\x99t so different from the aquatic depths they spent 10 years exploring. Halfway through the track, the music drops out and a metallic voice comes in: \xe2\x80\x9cUse the star chart to fix a celestial navigation point. From there you should be able to plug your path back to Earth using rudimentary astronomical guideposts.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a poignant bit of sci-fi ephemera. At the end of Drexciya\xe2\x80\x99s journey, and of Stinson\xe2\x80\x99s life, they\xe2\x80\x99re leading listeners back home to begin the quest all over again.'"
b'Parlor Walls',7.5,b'Opposites',0,b'Rock',b'March 15 2017',b'Brooklyn trio Parlor Walls subvert\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0dichotomy between rock and jazz. They\xc2\xa0approach aggression with an agility that\xe2\x80\x99s rare no matter the\xc2\xa0style of music.',"b'When the Bad Plus made their major label debut with These Are the Vistas in 2003, they generated heaps of praise for their supposed ability to capture a rock band\xe2\x80\x99s energy in a jazz trio format. But their hamfisted mistranslations of \xe2\x80\x9cSmells Like Teen Spirit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIron Man\xe2\x80\x9d were hardly revelatory. Between, say, the Lounge Lizards in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s up through to Neneh Cherry\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 collaboration with Swedish-Norweigan saxophonist Mats Gustafsson\xe2\x80\x99s trio the Thing, you can point to dozens of artists who have subverted or even nullified the dichotomy between jazz and rock. Brooklyn trio Parlor Walls sit in this\xc2\xa0lineage.' b'On their first full-length, Opposites, Parlor Walls convey urgency with a forcefulness that\xe2\x80\x99s both convincing and sophisticated. Like the Thing, core members Alyse Lamb and Chris Mulligan use repetitive phrases that speak directly to the gut\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9criffs,\xe2\x80\x9d for all intents and purposes. But where the Thing\xe2\x80\x99s meaty sound verges on street tough (in a good way), Parlor Walls approach aggression with an agility that\xe2\x80\x99s rare no matter what style of music you look at.' b'Frontwoman Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s guitar sounds as if it was run through a classic Fender Twin-style amp, a reverb-heavy tone that instantly evokes early rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll and rockabilly/surf twang. But the makeup of her chords has little in common with those forms. Even as Lamb slashes and wails with her guitar strings, her playing hovers at the music\xe2\x80\x99s outer edges, creating a cavernous ambience for Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s synth parts, which essentially perform the same function as a bass guitar. Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s drums tumble with the steady clang of a cement mixer\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99re loud, assertive, and colorful\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s his synth parts that actually drive the music and sustain its foundational groove. Meanwhile, nimble saxophonist Kate Mohanty plays a role akin to a rock guitarist\xe2\x80\x99s, supplying the most hummable licks in tandem with Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s synth lines.' b'Likeminded groups like Denmark\xe2\x80\x99s Selvhenter and England\xe2\x80\x99s Get the Blessing have shown over the past decade that it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible to uncover new shades of darkness by using jazz instrumentation in unconventional ways. Parlor Walls follow suit with Opposites and, in the process, lend new definition to the term \xe2\x80\x9cheavy.\xe2\x80\x9d Even without vocals, the album\xe2\x80\x99s mood would stand out, but Lamb\xe2\x80\x99s singing adds weight to the tension and intensifies what the other instruments are doing like a lit match held inches away from a puddle of gasoline.' b'A multifaceted vocalist, Lamb tends to be highly tuneful and dextrous. Still, her phrasing lands somewhere between taunting and alarm, and there are moments where she channels the spitfire edge of riot grrrl-era punk. She matches her vocals with appropriately complex lyrics that can be read a number of ways. Her verses percolate with obvious references to emotional ruptures, but she stops short of spelling them out. Her images pack a punch nevertheless:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCover me/To my knees/Keep me warm/Put me at ease/But you only feed me when you\xe2\x80\x99re full,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings on \xe2\x80\x9cCover Me.\xe2\x80\x9d Imagine having amnesia and speaking to someone who, you infer, has a bone to pick with you. At times, that\xe2\x80\x99s what this album feels like.' b'Meanwhile, the guitar and sax flit like moving shadows cast by strobing red and blue siren lights outside your window. All of these elements combine to create a sinister vibe that rides the line between pleasant and imposing. On \xe2\x80\x9cPlay Opposites,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Lamb asks, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go/And play opposites?/Burn it to the ground/There ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing left.\xe2\x80\x9d And on \xe2\x80\x9cHesitation,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, \xe2\x80\x9cCome through, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave my light on/Rearrange my shapes/We can imagine partition/Then see it all fall away.\xe2\x80\x9d Lamb probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t referring to the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cpartition\xe2\x80\x9d between jazz and rock, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just as well that we let it fall away. Other bands have given us reason to do the same for years, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make Opposites any less extraordinary.'"
b'Jean-Michel Blais'b'CFCF',7.3,b'Cascades',0,b'Electronic',b'March 15 2017',b'Michael Silver of CFCF teams with pianist Jean-Michel Blais on a sometimes-gorgeous collection of ambient pieces.',"b'Montreal\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Silver maintains an exhausting workload as CFCF. In 2015 alone, he dropped two albums, a Blowing Up the Workshop mix of original material, and an EP. Equally impressive is how Silver strikes\xe2\x80\x94and maintains\xe2\x80\x94a careful balance between charming electronic music and sounds we otherwise look down on: lite-jazz, adult contemporary, Windham Hill-esque new age. In an appreciation of CFCF last year, the New York Times sussed Silver\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic as where \xe2\x80\x9cuncool become[s] cool\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdefiantly corny.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""That balancing act continues into the present with Cascades, Silver\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with newcomer and fellow Canadian, pianist Jean-Michel Blais. Together, they move into some new genre terrain to mixed results. Blais only just released his debut album last year, but he's\xc2\xa0been making minimalist piano music on his own for two decades while teaching music by day. An album featuring\xc2\xa0piano and electronics is generally an austere exercise, as the resonance between piano keys provides the space in which best to insert electronic washes\xe2\x80\x94see Fennesz and Sakamoto or, more recently, Bing & Ruth.\xc2\xa0This five-track EP finds Silver and Blais\xc2\xa0warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record's end."" b""They open with \xe2\x80\x9cHasselblad 1,\xe2\x80\x9d a restrained piece that showcases Blais\xe2\x80\x99 ability to expand the melodic lines with eloquence, leaving just a few patches of space for Silver to dab in with additional color. It\xe2\x80\x99s lovely, but it feels like they're establishing their respective spaces rather than moving as a single unit. On \xe2\x80\x9cTwo Mirrors,\xe2\x80\x9d Blais hammers a repetitive piano line redolent of Philip Glass, finding new accents and rhythms in it, steadily adding to the theme in the upper and lower registers. Outside of some atmospheric moments, you'd\xc2\xa0be hard-pressed to pinpoint which sounds belong to Silver, as he allows Blais and his piano to dominate. Silver\xe2\x80\x99s synths swell and find more space on the gentle \xe2\x80\x9cSpirit.\xe2\x80\x9d At times it\xe2\x80\x99s reminiscent of Boards of Canada, but Blais deftly nudges the piece away from such a tangible aesthetic."" b""By this point, they're clicking, and the record has successfully outlined its parameters. But the delicate mix of sounds is derailed by \xe2\x80\x9cHypocrite,\xe2\x80\x9d wherein the duo edge into questionable territory. A rolling melody from Blais provides the drama for the piece. But when Silver enters, it\xe2\x80\x99s with his synths set to \xe2\x80\x9cEDM.\xe2\x80\x9d In this setting, the drama of Blais\xe2\x80\x99 piano pushes the track to the brink of being \xe2\x80\x9cbig tent,\xe2\x80\x9d as if the Piano Guys got a makeover by OWSLA."" b'They remedy the situation with Cascades\xe2\x80\x99s longest piece, a stunning rendition of John Cage\xe2\x80\x99s 1948 piece, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a Landscape.\xe2\x80\x9d For those more familiar with Cage\xe2\x80\x99s later work, which embraces silence, dissonance, and chance operations, \xe2\x80\x9cLandscape\xe2\x80\x9d is a melodic composition clearly indebted to ambient godfather Erik Satie. On this version, Blais\xe2\x80\x99 piano moves at a stately pace as Silver adds flickering electronics and a bit of radio chatter in the background (perhaps a sly nod to Cage\xe2\x80\x99s shortwave radio piece, \xe2\x80\x9cImaginary Landscape\xe2\x80\x9d?). Four minutes in, marimba and chimes ripple and synthesized strings quiver to life and it evokes a rolling pastoral scene\xc2\xa0the moment the sunlight lands upon it just so, so that every tree and hill on the horizon seems to glow golden. For all of the uneven and uncertain moments of Cascades, it ends on a very high note, and \xe2\x80\x9cLandscape\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable.'"

Performed entirely solo, released with little\xc2\xa0fanfare and bearing a distressing, cabin-fever ambience, it offered the\xc2\xa0first and final word on a once-unspeakably rough time in his life. Ruminations\xc2\xa0was Oberst\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0strongest record in years, but no one would want him to make it a second time. Less than six months later,\xc2\xa0Salutations is an even more curious move.\xc2\xa0Oberst re-recorded all 10\xc2\xa0songs with a full band and a host of guests, added seven new ones and hit shuffle\xe2\x80\x94a decision that drags\xc2\xa0*Salutations *down\xc2\xa0and bring its predecessor along with it.' b'After a series of lesser-loved guises\xe2\x80\x94inscrutable mystic, folk-rock yeoman\xe2\x80\x94Oberst has found a more interesting and sustainable point of view. A kind way of putting it would be \xe2\x80\x9cworld-weary raconteur.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps a more accurate way would be \xe2\x80\x9ckind of an asshole.\xe2\x80\x9d The prospect of hearing another dude do this for about 70 minutes is a hard sell at a time when Father John Misty, Drake, Mark Kozelek,\xc2\xa0and Future have released approximately 9 hours of music in the past year that wearily postulates from a position of privilege on their dissatisfaction with sex, drugs, and everyone outside of their immediate circle. The difference here is that Oberst only hops on a pedestal for the purpose of knocking himself down.' b'In his post-poster boy phase, Oberst is no longer trapped by expectation or myth; he\xc2\xa0can play his past personas against each other. \xe2\x80\x9cAfterthought\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOverdue\xe2\x80\x9d respectively caricature the roles he played on his 2005 diptych of protest song\xc2\xa0and smack-addled narcolepsy, presenting the\xc2\xa0narrator as someone for whom extreme politics and heroin are just another fix. On the opener\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cToo Late to Fixate,\xe2\x80\x9d he half-asses his way through transcendental meditation only to find serenity in the luxuries of a hotel feather bed and a mistress to lay upon it: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the money/It beats betting on sports/And though it might get expensive/It\xe2\x80\x99s cheaper than divorce.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'These aren\xe2\x80\x99t new topics for Oberst, but he\xe2\x80\x99s never been this flat-out funny, providing a necessarily salty and bitter edge as he reverts back to the tasteful roots rock that has defined his past decade. This approach reflects\xc2\xa0of Oberst\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0status as a Nonesuch recording artist who hangs out with the Felice Brothers and Dawes, but it also shows the dividing line between \xe2\x80\x9ccrowd pleaser\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccult builder.\xe2\x80\x9d Though *Ruminations *was the inverse of the fire-breathing agitpop of his band\xc2\xa0Desaparecidos\xe2\x80\x99 2015 LP\xc2\xa0*Payola**, *both serve as proof of the extreme measures necessary to steer Oberst away from the middle of the road\xe2\x80\x94where *Salutations *spends well over an hour.' b'The most rewarding records of this length carry a mutual assumption of risk. Listeners will indulge the occasional faceplant as long as the artist is making an attempt to reach new personal heights. Though\xc2\xa0Salutations is one of Oberst\xe2\x80\x99s most demanding albums, it\xe2\x80\x99s also one of his least ambitious, even\xc2\xa0before taking these new arrangements into account*.*\xc2\xa0The righteous indignation of \xe2\x80\x9cYou All Loved Him Once\xe2\x80\x9d was devastating when it was Oberst alone; recast now as \xe2\x80\x9cOberst and the Felice Brothers against the world,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s less believable. \xe2\x80\x9cCounting Sheep\xe2\x80\x9d dulls its edge in the most literal way imaginable: On *Ruminations, *Oberst mused on the death of\xc2\xa0two local youths, hoping it was both slow and painful while censoring out their names. He actually reveals them here, but changes the lyric to \xe2\x80\x9cHope it was quick, hope it was peaceful.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Even if *Ruminations *is now rendered a collection of demos, it was unquestionably an *album\xe2\x80\x94*thematically and sonically coherent and perfectly sequenced.\xc2\xa0Salutations muddles that. On\xc2\xa0Ruminations,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cYou All Loved Him Once\xe2\x80\x9d was the penultimate track, settling scores. And it led\xc2\xa0into\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTill St. Dymphna Kicks Us Out,\xe2\x80\x9d which\xc2\xa0implored those who stuck around\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0forget old memories and make new ones. The latter is now stuck right in the middle of Salutations\xc2\xa0and this diminishes the song\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0effect. (Just imagine\xc2\xa0if Oberst had lost his nerve in 2005 and recorded the caustic electro-pop of Digital Ash\xc2\xa0as folk songs and slapped them onto I\xe2\x80\x99m Wide Awake, It\xe2\x80\x99s Morning**.)\xc2\xa0From a songwriting standpoint, Salutations is an undeniable triumph\xe2\x80\x94for people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard Ruminations yet.

Her identity evolved from romantic pragmatist to underdog sage to mystic troubadour; her voice became distant and supercilious, baring just enough soul to reassure you one was there. Radical honesty is now common among\xc2\xa0young songwriters, but Marling can harbor guilt, fear, arrogance, deceit, or triumph\xc2\xa0in a bottomless deadpan. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to invest in her evasion.' b'Semper Femina\xe2\x80\x94Latin for \xe2\x80\x9cAlways a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d and taken from Virgil\xe2\x80\x99s epic poem The Aeneid\xe2\x80\x94is no revolutionary screed. But the album\xe2\x80\x99s characters, who are all given female pronouns, tiptoe\xc2\xa0outside Marling\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0world of heartbreak and personal redemption. There are signs of\xc2\xa0a broader project at play. With lyrics about\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cwarning signs\xe2\x80\x9d that we\xe2\x80\x99re conditioned to \xe2\x80\x9cignore diligently,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNext Time\xe2\x80\x9d appears to preach\xc2\xa0a maternal fondness for Mother Earth: \xe2\x80\x9cI can no longer close my eyes/While the world around me dies/At the hands/Of folks/Like me,\xe2\x80\x9d she trills. While her composure hasn\xe2\x80\x99t wavered since 2010\xe2\x80\x99s I Speak Because I Can, there\xe2\x80\x99s something new\xc2\xa0in songs like \xe2\x80\x9cNext Time\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Pass Me By.\xe2\x80\x9d Both remind me, in their reserve and understated melancholy, of mid-career Elliott Smith\xe2\x80\x94a chaotic and vulnerable individual anchored by a preternatural understanding of melody, using compassion to navigate horror.' b'As\xc2\xa0Semper Femina\xe2\x80\x99s questions deepen, answers\xc2\xa0rarely materialize. The gorgeous \xe2\x80\x9cAlways This Way\xe2\x80\x9d mourns a friendship cut short in unexplained circumstances. As sorrow\xc2\xa0triggers a bout of soul-searching, Marling confesses, \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty-five years and nothing to show for it/Nothing of any weight.\xe2\x80\x9d Over pastoral guitar twirls, the narrator soothes herself with a mantra, though not a satisfying one: \xe2\x80\x9cAt least I can say/That my debts have been paid.\xe2\x80\x9d The conciliation feels a little flimsy.\xc2\xa0A songwriter as meticulous as Marling doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to innovate, but she\xe2\x80\x99s most intriguing on songs like \xe2\x80\x9cSoothing,\xe2\x80\x9d when her cryptic lyrics snowball without scrambling for\xc2\xa0narrative closure.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cSoothing\xe2\x80\x9d is also the record\xe2\x80\x99s only really\xc2\xa0ambitious composition. Interlocked basslines quarrel under Marling\xe2\x80\x99s magisterial tones. Its image of a \xe2\x80\x9ccreepy conjurer\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9chands are in the door\xe2\x80\x9d hangs elegantly unresolved. She sings\xc2\xa0her sendoff\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI banish you with love\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94through luscious minor notes that, instead of sugarcoating the rejection, transfigure it. Banishment becomes liberation, a generous act. The philosophy\xc2\xa0develops on \xe2\x80\x9cWild Fire\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThere no sweeter deed may be,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings, \xe2\x80\x9cThan to love something enough/To want to help it get free.\xe2\x80\x9d As is Marling\xe2\x80\x99s trademark, the line blossoms\xc2\xa0as both a revelation\xe2\x80\x94the narrator takes pleasure in her wisdom\xe2\x80\x94and a reprimand to a clingy partner, someone unsuited\xc2\xa0to her passionate independence.' b'Where Semper Femina might have sketched a feminist utopia, Marling instead uses her broad study of femininity to explore flawed, sometimes devastating relationships between women. The full Virgil quote\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA woman is an ever fickle and changeable thing\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94could seem patronizing, but Marling quotes it fondly on \xe2\x80\x9cNouel.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0She is tirelessly\xc2\xa0nuanced, and the result is an album filled with beautiful, searching observations on the psychology of friendship and occasionally romance. \xe2\x80\x9cI think your mama\xe2\x80\x99s kinda sad/And your papa\xe2\x80\x99s kinda mean,\xe2\x80\x9d she sneers on \xe2\x80\x9cWild Fire.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI can take that all away/You can stop playing it out on me.\xe2\x80\x9d Marling\xc2\xa0proposes here that love is\xc2\xa0a defense\xc2\xa0against our parents\xe2\x80\x99 pathologies\xe2\x80\x94yet she acknowledges that the traits\xc2\xa0we inherit are\xc2\xa0stubborn, determined to sneak in\xc2\xa0and mangle beauty. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fitting parallel to how Marling\xc2\xa0wrestles with, and masters, her ever more malleable folk idiom.'"

Likewise, the more polished\xc2\xa0Spiral* Scratch* was at least as important to punk as the Sex Pistols\xe2\x80\x99 rise.""","b'In 1981, with disco medleys of former pop hits like \xe2\x80\x9cStars on 45\xe2\x80\x9d climbing the charts around the world, a cluster of British punk rockers recorded their own medley of old favorites. The Friendly Hopefuls\xe2\x80\x99 Tribute to the Punks of \xe2\x80\x9976\xc2\xa0begins with the standard looped clap track and a slick, professional-sounding chorus singing: \xe2\x80\x9cHey hey/Remember that day/In 1976/When the music scene was boring/Until along came\xe2\x80\x94this!\xe2\x80\x9d And the guitar riff from the Buzzcocks\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cBoredom\xe2\x80\x9d kicks in.' b'*Spiral Scratch\xe2\x80\x94*the four-song debut EP on which \xe2\x80\x9cBoredom\xe2\x80\x9d appeared\xe2\x80\x94was a revelation. British punk rock was brand new at that point: when Spiral Scratch\xc2\xa0was released on January 29, 1977, the Sex Pistols\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cAnarchy in the U.K.\xe2\x80\x9d was barely two months old, the Damned, the Vibrators, and the Stranglers had some singles out, and that was it. All those bands were signed to at-least-sort-of-legitimate record labels. Meanwhile, the Buzzcocks scraped together the funds to have 1000 copies of Spiral Scratch pressed themselves, and called their otherwise nonexistent label New Hormones.' b'The masterminds behind the band at that point\xe2\x80\x94singer/guitarist Howard Devoto and guitarist Pete Shelley\xe2\x80\x94weren\xe2\x80\x99t Londoners like the earliest wave of UK punks. They were from unfashionable Manchester, a couple of hours\xe2\x80\x99 train ride north. In the fall of 1975, Devoto and Shelley read about the Sex Pistols, traveled down to London to see them, and came back inspired to start a band of their own. The Buzzcocks\xe2\x80\x99 first complete set was opening for the second of two legendary Pistols shows in Manchester during the summer of 1976.' b'*Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up\xe2\x80\x94*initially a bootleg in 1978, and officially released in 1991\xe2\x80\x94is an invaluable document. It\'s the demo Buzzcocks recorded on October 18, 1976\xe2\x80\x94all snarls, yelps, and distortion, while also sounding entirely joyful. They revel in rock bands\xe2\x80\x99 newly-won right to present themselves as mean and aggressive and to say ""fuck"" out loud. Devoto sings as if Johnny Rotten is the only other vocalist he\xe2\x80\x99s ever heard, and always seems about to break into giggles. \xe2\x80\x9cYou tear me up, you bloody swine!\xe2\x80\x9d he yells with adenoidal delight. \xe2\x80\x9cOrgasm Addict,\xe2\x80\x9d which they\xe2\x80\x99d re-record as a single a year later, isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite fully formed yet, but Devoto\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes about stained jeans, as well as his whining gasps, were genuinely transgressive for their moment.' b'The band is still finding its feet on *Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up, *especially\xc2\xa0as\xc2\xa0teenage drummer John Maher slowed down the tempo every time he attempted to play a fill. Still, they worked out how to vigorously\xc2\xa0shove their songs forward. The two covers that were part of their live set at the time revealed a bit about where Buzzcocks were coming from: A sped-up version of the Troggs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Control Myself\xe2\x80\x9d anticipates the love of popcraft that would shortly surface in their own songs and a heavily rewritten take on Captain Beefheart\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Love You, You Big Dummy\xe2\x80\x9d (which Devoto would take with him to his subsequent band Magazine) hints at the odder, artier side of their later records.' b'Two months after the Time\xe2\x80\x99s Up demos, they re-recorded four of those songs with producer Martin Hannett as Spiral Scratch. A few more weeks of practice had done wonders for the Buzzcocks\xe2\x80\x99 sound: now they were fast, strong and acrobatically tight. They powered through \xe2\x80\x9cBreakdown\xe2\x80\x9d in two minutes flat\xc2\xa0and started to sound more like themselves than like the Pistols or the Ramones. In fact, the Ramones would ape the two-note guitar solo gag in \xe2\x80\x9cBoredom\xe2\x80\x9d for their own on \xe2\x80\x9cI Wanna Be Sedated.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""The great joke of Devoto\xe2\x80\x99s performance here is that, on the first record by a new band at the vanguard of a new musical movement, he presents himself as utterly over everything\xe2\x80\x94including punk in general. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m already a has-been,\xe2\x80\x9d he sneers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the scene is\xe2\x80\x94very humdrum!\xe2\x80\x9d He wasn't kidding\xc2\xa0because less than a week after Spiral Scratch\xe2\x80\x99s release, Devoto quit the Buzzcocks, and Shelley took his place as the band\xe2\x80\x99s frontman."" b'By the time they stopped re-pressing the EP in the summer of 1977, Buzzcocks had sold 16,000 copies of it. In its way, Spiral Scratch was at least as important to punk as the Sex Pistols\xe2\x80\x99 rise, because it was the first record of its kind to erase the axioms that the art and business of pop music were necessarily separate, and that a band could never be important until it signed to a \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d record label. Buzzcocks said fuck it and decided to just do it themselves.'"

He's the last great hope of the class of 2012,\xc2\xa0back when drill music first crumbled the city\xe2\x80\x99s pavements to dust. Chief Keef\xe2\x80\x99s indiscipline killed his momentum. Lil Reese sank under the weight of a charge sheet. King Louie is still around, making the kind of graphene-tough drill that sledgehammered its way into hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s collective conscious a half-decade ago. But only one rapper calls himself the Allah of Chi-Town."" b'Durk Banks was still in his teens when he signed to Def Jam in 2012, ostensibly becoming one of drill\xe2\x80\x99s great crossover hopes. He dropped two commercially-minded albums on the label and scored minor hits with \xe2\x80\x9cLike Me\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy Beyonc\xc3\xa9,\xe2\x80\x9d syrupy jams that made good use of the rapper\xe2\x80\x99s pop instincts. But he\xe2\x80\x99s never been able to parlay any of these achievements into large-scale embracement. Or even, say, Meek Mill-esque sales. The final few steps always elude him.' b'Love Song for the Streets doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concern itself with mainstream acceptance. Instead, we get no false starts or unwise experiments, just Durk unfiltered: nine shots of garbled Auto-Tune vocals, punchy lyricism, goofy sex jams, and hooks that stick.' b""Unshackled from any kind of outline, Durk\xe2\x80\x99s pen game shines. His rise was dotted with blood-soaked tales that summarized much of drill\xe2\x80\x99s appeal: ground-level glimpses at Chicago's South Side that colored in the outline offered by grim murder statistics. Love Song for the Streets, though, finds the father-of-two in a more mournful mood. He\xe2\x80\x99s still only 24, but he raps with the weariness of someone who has seen too damn much."" b'\xe2\x80\x9cPick Your Poison\xe2\x80\x9d is a robust smack down of so-called friends that abandoned him when goings got tough. \xe2\x80\x9cHell yeah I hold a grudge,\xe2\x80\x9d Durk spits over Will-A-Fool\xe2\x80\x99s dark production, \xe2\x80\x9cthese niggas ain\xe2\x80\x99t show no love.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Later, he offers some open-book revelations: \xe2\x80\x9cI used to chew on them xannies to get me through the times.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s a touch of Curtis Mayfield in Durk\xe2\x80\x99s gloss-free depiction of urban living\xe2\x80\x94hard times in this crazy town.' b'In Durk\xe2\x80\x99s world, viciousness is a part of life\xe2\x80\x99s mundanity.

Durk\xe2\x80\x99s ugly-beautiful vocals punctuate\xc2\xa0one of\xc2\xa0coldest visions of Chicago.' b'As a front-to-back production job, Love Song for the Streets feels raw, dinky, and inexpensive. The gritty orchestration melds itself inseparably from Durk\xe2\x80\x99s synthetic vocals. \xe2\x80\x9cNo Love,\xe2\x80\x9d produced by S Breezy, is built on some twisted guitar notes, a thumping bass line, and lots of dead space for Durk and guest Young Thug to fill. Tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cMood\xe2\x80\x9d have more in common with Thugger\xe2\x80\x99s favored future-cop production style than the horror movie\xc2\xa0theatrics of drill, while Durk\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0strong sense of melody shines on the\xc2\xa0sleazy ode to his girl, \xe2\x80\x9cUzi.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Drill was largely built around incredibly young rappers burdened with many of the troubles listeners found so thrilling. Five years later, Durk is reporting from the firestorm while trying to grow up within it.

His gift for making fussy arrangements seem effortless remains unparalleled.'","b'Dismantling the old Shins lineup must have been a bittersweet trade-off for James Mercer. On one hand, it freed him\xc2\xa0from the interpersonal conflicts inherent in running a band like a democracy, which surely\xc2\xa0was a relief to a songwriter who never prided himself on his people skills. But it also placed a weight on his shoulders. The sole burden of the band\xe2\x80\x99s music and image now falls squarely on Mercer, including formalities that never seemed to come to him as easy to him as the songs did. During the band\xe2\x80\x99s mid-\xe2\x80\x9900s peak, for instance, Mercer often positioned himself toward the side of stage in concert, happily outsourcing traditional frontman duties like joking and bantering to his gregarious sideman Marty Crandall.' b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Mercer\xc2\xa0laid off his bandmates for creative reasons, as he\xe2\x80\x99s judiciously insisted, or if Crandall\xe2\x80\x99s arrest for domestic assault left him no choice. Either way, he no longer has a real band to help him carry the load, and it takes a toll on him. While the Shins\xe2\x80\x99 music hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed markedly since that purge in 2008, its image has. The press photos tell the whole story. Remember those old pics of colorful indie dudes horsing around? They\xe2\x80\x99ve been replaced by shots of a lone, forlorn middle-aged guy, trying and utterly failing to look like he\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying himself. The songwriters Mercer most looks up to\xe2\x80\x94icons like Morrissey, Ian McCulloch, Lennon and McCartney\xe2\x80\x94were stars born for the stage, but Mercer never shared their comfort with the limelight. In an interview with NME this winter, he relayed these pressures. \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes at weird moments in life,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cLike we went for this big meal the other night because the Shins are releasing a new record, and then I realized that it\xe2\x80\x99s just me in the Shins so all those people were there for me.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'That may be why, for his 2012 Shins reboot Port of Morrow, he created a sort of shadow band, inviting guests like Janet Weiss, Joe Plummer, and Eric Johnson to help carry the weight. As if to suggest\xc2\xa0that the Shins were still a band,\xc2\xa0Mercer posed in promo photos with his touring lineup. Heartworms, however, is the first album where he fully embraces the reality that he is the Shins. Self-produced and recorded with a smaller cast than its predecessor, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most hermetic\xc2\xa0LP he\xe2\x80\x99s released since 2001\xe2\x80\x99s Oh, Inverted World, the last album he recorded himself. At times it overtly calls back to that debut. With its psychedelic patter, \xe2\x80\x9cDead Alive\xe2\x80\x9d is an almost direct sequel to \xe2\x80\x9cOne by One All Day,\xe2\x80\x9d drawing out that song\xe2\x80\x99s reverb-soaked outro into its own romp, like some kind of self-written\xc2\xa0fan fiction.' b'For as openly as Mercer discusses his anxiety (he dedicates Heartworms\xe2\x80\x99s final song, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fear,\xe2\x80\x9d to it), he still\xc2\xa0adheres to a disciplined, \xe2\x80\x9cnever let them see you sweat\xe2\x80\x9d approach in the studio. He creates the illusion that songs come to him quickly, as if pulled from thin air, even if the five year gaps between the last few Shins albums argue otherwise. His gift for making fussy arrangements seem effortless remains unparalleled. Heartworms\xe2\x80\x99 chipper title track is all weightless wonder, as free and euphoric as anything on Inverted World. Opener \xe2\x80\x9cName for You,\xe2\x80\x9d a sweetly encouraging piece written for his three daughters, plays as if he\xc2\xa0raced to the studio to record it while it was still fresh in his mind. And the most Chutes Too Narrow-esque number, \xe2\x80\x9cMildenhall,\xe2\x80\x9d shares the same live looseness as that album\xe2\x80\x99s country tunes. An unabashedly autobiographical origin story, it details Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s evolution\xc2\xa0from military brat to indie rocker: A classmate passes him a Jesus and Mary Chain cassette; he starts fiddling with his dad\xe2\x80\x99s guitar; his dad teaches him some simple chords and, yada yada yada, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how we get to where we are now.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s often been a tension, albeit only a mild one, between Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s classicist pop impulses and his more progressive leanings, and some of that creeps in here, too. The nervy, acid-washed \xe2\x80\x9cPainting a\xc2\xa0Hole\xe2\x80\x9d plays like something Kevin Barnes might concoct after several sunless days sequestered in a studio\xe2\x80\x94its groove is heavier and nastier than any Danger Mouse has cooked up for him in Broken Bells. \xe2\x80\x9cCherry Hearts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFantasy Island\xe2\x80\x9d each call attention to themselves with grimy keyboard tones and deep, almost 808-esque low ends. In the past, Mercer has tripped over these kinds of experiments (\xe2\x80\x9cSea Legs\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any less clumsy today than it did a decade ago), but here he lands them with the confidence of an old pro aware of\xc2\xa0his limitations.' b'Like many of the indie bands from his era, including fellow pop true believers the New Pornographers and\xc2\xa0Death Cab for Cutie\xe2\x80\x94one of the few other acts from the mid-\xe2\x80\x9900s indie boom still on a major label\xe2\x80\x94Mercer has survived by staying the course. He has largely resisted trends or any temptation to drift too far from his established sweet spot. The thrill of discovery may be gone\xe2\x80\x94really, it disappeared with Wincing the Night Away\xe2\x80\x94yet it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable how little rust he\xe2\x80\x99s showing. And although Heartworms never quite conjures the magic of those first couple Shins albums, it\xe2\x80\x99s further\xc2\xa0proof that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t a fluke. This guy always did, and still does, know how to write a song that sticks.'"
b'Midori Takada',8.7,b'Through the Looking Glass',1,b'Experimental',b'March 13 2017',"b""The Japanese composer\xc2\xa0Midori Takada's newly reissued album is an\xc2\xa0assimilation of musical modes from around the world. It belongs in the pantheon alongside Steve Reich's most notable works.""","b'In a perfect world, Japanese composer Midori Takada and her works for percussion would be as revered and renowned as that of Steve Reich. Much like that world-renowned American composer, Takada drew influence from a study of African drumming and Asian music, and surmised how these sensibilities dovetailed with that of minimalism, serving as means to break with the Western classical tradition (she originally was a percussionist in the Berlin RIAS Symphonie Orchestra at the Berlin Philharmonic). But with only a handful of works to her name and all of it long out of print\xe2\x80\x94be it with her groundbreaking percussion trio Mkwaju Ensemble, the group Ton-Klami or the three solo albums she released across nearly two decades\xe2\x80\x94her music has been impossible to hear since the early 1990s.' b'Only last year did two pieces from Takada\xe2\x80\x99s Mkwaju Ensemble appear on last year\xe2\x80\x99s crucial More Better Days compilation, revealing Takada\xe2\x80\x99s singular approach to spartan yet euphoric percussion pieces. Touching on gamelan, kodo, and American minimalism (Takada founded the trio in part to perform the works of Reich, Terry Riley, and other 20th-century percussion pieces), each one built carefully to sublime effect. When Visible Cloaks\xe2\x80\x99 member Spencer Doran released his influential mixes of Japanese music, selections from both Mkwaju and Takada\xe2\x80\x99s solo percussion pieces appeared at crucial junctures.' b'The rarest of all of Takada\xe2\x80\x99s works though was her 1983 solo effort, Through the Looking Glass, never released on CD and fetching ludicrous sums online for an original vinyl copy. Unable to financially sustain Mkwaju, Takada disbanded the ensemble and entered the studio by herself to realize this music. Over the course of two days, she put to analog tape all four of the extended performances here as well as laying down the overdubs, producing and mixing (with help from an engineer) the album on her own. An astonishing feat in and of itself, Looking Glass is one of the most dazzling works of minimalism, be it from the East or West.' b""\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Henri Rousseau's Dream\xe2\x80\x9d is an assured opening, one that moves at its own slow, hushed pace. Takada astutely layers marimba, gongs, rattles and other ambient bits of chimes, recorder, tam-tam and mimics bird calls with an ocarina. In its understated pulsing of marimba, it brings to mind Gavin Bryars\xe2\x80\x99 work from the same era, most notably Hommages on the Les Disques Du Cr\xc3\xa9puscule imprint. There appears to be little in the way of linear development as Takada instead crafts and sustains an entire landscape of these small sounds, letting them all levitate in mid-air for twelve heavenly minutes."" b'With \xe2\x80\x9cCrossing,\xe2\x80\x9d a bit of momentum builds up from a single struck cowbell. Takada goes back over the original clonk and starts to layer interweaving lines on marimba, each successive line increasing the complexity of the lines. More cowbell comes in and suddenly Takada begins to simulate the ornate polyrhythms of Reich\xe2\x80\x99s Drumming all by herself in the studio. And with the introduction of a crossing marimba pattern and the drone of a harmonium some five-and-a-half minutes into the piece, it moves into its own rarefied space.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrompe-L\xe2\x80\x99oeil\xe2\x80\x9d moves at a more relaxed pace, with Takada\xe2\x80\x99s harmonium lines swaying like an accordion and her use of a Coke bottle as both reed and percussion giving the piece a playful air about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a breather before the finale of the album, the fifteen-minute pressure cooker of percussion, \xe2\x80\x9cCatastrophe \xce\xa3.\xe2\x80\x9d Using the harmonium to create a darker mood, Takada focuses on tom-tom, bongos, cymbal and a bit of piano to ratchet up and sustain tension over the course of the piece. There\xe2\x80\x99s a breathlessness to the piece as it gathers momentum that makes it one of the most thrilling percussion pieces of its kind.' b'While her American influences always had an exploratory aspect to their most famous works, there\xe2\x80\x99s never a moment on, say, \xe2\x80\x9cMusic for 18 Musicians\xe2\x80\x9d where you feel like Reich lets loose his rein even a millimeter. There\xe2\x80\x99s something about Takada and the joy of creating this album that fully emerges in this last quarter-hour, as she builds energy up with her drums, her harmonium and that ever-present cowbell. In the liner notes to this reissue, Takada explained just what she learned in her studies of African and Asian music that led her to abandoned Western classical music as a pursuit way back when. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a performer, this music asked you to personally examine your own physical transformation and to confirm and share this transformation with your counterpart, group or tribe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe music stops short of imposing sovereignty or nationality.\xe2\x80\x9d And even as the finale builds to a glorious climax, it too stops short. Takada pulls it all away at the last possible moment, a thrill that allows her listeners\xe2\x80\x94nearly thirty-five years on\xe2\x80\x94to soar to a space well within themselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s a space well worth rediscovery.'"

But their lyrics can\xc2\xa0drip with sarcastic self-effacement, adding bite to their sound.'","b'If you know just one thing about the duo Tennis, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably that they were born at sea. Their craft is called Swift Ranger, it\xe2\x80\x99s 30 feet from stem to stern, and it inspired Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore\xe2\x80\x99s first album, 2011\xe2\x80\x99s Cape Dory. For their latest, Yours Conditionally, Tennis clambered back onto the boat for an ocean jaunt\xe2\x80\x94from San Diego to the Sea of Cortez\xe2\x80\x94and, they hoped, for artistic rejuvenation.' b'But whether they are landlocked or bobbing at sea, Tennis remain devoted to a specific span of musical history, drawing on the beautifully rendered tunes that emerged between pop\xe2\x80\x99s Wall of Sound era and the eruption of punk\xe2\x80\x99s unkempt energies, give or take a few years. Think along the lines of Evie Sands\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Let Go,\xe2\x80\x9d a stringless version of the Carpenters\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cThey Long to Be (Close to You),\xe2\x80\x9d Dusty Springfield\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEasy Evil,\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cAngel\xe2\x80\x9d side of Fleetwood Mac\xe2\x80\x99s catalog. These are unimpeachable reference points\xe2\x80\x94plenty of other acts would do well to study similar benchmarks\xe2\x80\x94but they also pose a forbiddingly high bar.' b'On 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Ritual in Repeat, Tennis rose above pastiche and wrote a few sturdy tunes that stood apart from the history they channelled. The group achieves this again two or three times on *Yours Conditionally, *displaying a keen appreciation for harmony, balmy keyboards, and analog-sounding bass. When the guitar doubles and then embellishes the primary progression on the outro of \xe2\x80\x9cBaby Don\xe2\x80\x99t Believe,\xe2\x80\x9d or when Moore arcs her singing downward without warning on \xe2\x80\x9cModern Woman,\xe2\x80\x9d the band\xc2\xa0lifts off.' b'Lyrically, the album seesaws between portraits of perfect love and something decidedly more ambivalent. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Emotions Are Blinding\xe2\x80\x9d drips with sarcastic self-effacement: \xe2\x80\x9cIf the night goes exactly as planned,\xe2\x80\x9d Moore sings, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be giving all my attention/To the world\xe2\x80\x99s most interesting man.\xe2\x80\x9d She delivers sweet nothings in the next song, \xe2\x80\x9cFields of Blue\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI really love you, I cannot help myself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94milking the contrast between tone and message.' b""\xe2\x80\x9cLadies Don't Play Guitar\xe2\x80\x9d is more pointed. Here, Moore offers a send-up of female-as-male-muse, adding bite\xc2\xa0and an incisiveness\xc2\xa0that feels new for this band. \xe2\x80\x9cLadies don\xe2\x80\x99t play guitar/ Ladies don\xe2\x80\x99t get down down to the sound of it,\xe2\x80\x9d she sings. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we can play pretend?\xe2\x80\x9d Moore, of course, does play guitar; on Yours Conditionally, she also contributes keys, piano, and some percussion. As she\xc2\xa0presents a caricature of a woman on the sidelines supporting her rock-star-lover\xe2\x80\x99s dreams\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cLadies just need your love...\xc2\xa0I can be the archetype of whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re feeling\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94she\xc2\xa0undermines it immediately with her presence in the song."" b'Despite the lyrical punch, Yours Conditionally is hamstrung by Tennis\xe2\x80\x99 drums. The keys and bass on the album are unfailingly warm, but the shabby percussion is one-note, almost the work of a different band. This feels like an eyesore amid an otherwise splendid view, an indie affectation that causes the duo to fall just short of their tasteful influences.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, because Tennis\xe2\x80\x99 return to Swift Ranger furnished them with some of their best material yet.'"
b'Children of Alice',7.3,b'Children of Alice',0,b'Experimental',b'March 13 2017',"b'The collaboration between members of Broadcast and Focus Group creates lovingly rendered ambiance\xc2\xa0born of library music and musique concr\xc3\xa8te, steeped in eeriness and sweetened with wonder.'","b'For those attuned to Broadcast and the Focus Group\xe2\x80\x99s wavelength, the 2009 collaborative album Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age\xc2\xa0was a hallowed union. Throughout the 2000s, Broadcast had reimagined psych-rock in a way that mirrored the Focus Group\xe2\x80\x99s adventures in library music and musique concr\xc3\xa8te\xe2\x80\x94both artists\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0warped nostalgia and movie-music mania\xc2\xa0dealt in\xc2\xa0temporal freefall, with spectral production\xc2\xa0that exhumed ghosts\xc2\xa0from radio static. On Witch Cults, these hauntological peas in a pod simultaneously peaked: In Trish Keenan\xe2\x80\x99s daydream deadpan, the\xc2\xa0Focus Group\xe2\x80\x99s Julian House found an anchor for his abstractions, while Broadcast\xe2\x80\x99s oneiric detail flourished anew, unmoored once and for all from rock\xe2\x80\x99s retro\xc2\xa0swing.' b'Six years after Keenan\xe2\x80\x99s death, it\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit of\xc2\xa0Witch Cults\xc2\xa0that pervades Children of Alice, James Cargill\xe2\x80\x99s new post-Broadcast project with Julian House and Broadcast keyboardist Roj Stevens. Their debut\xc2\xa0ventures further into sonic\xc2\xa0wormholes\xe2\x80\x94the structures are byzantine, melodies vanishingly sparse\xe2\x80\x94but has the same buzz of eccentric minds dialing into a familiar frequency.' b'The trio, named in honor of Keenan\xe2\x80\x99s beloved\xc2\xa0Alice in Wonderland, make music steeped in eeriness and sweetened with wonder. Children of Alice\xc2\xa0opens with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Harbinger of Spring,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a strangled hum mingles with birdsong and children\xe2\x80\x99s laughter. Beneath it all looms a three-note bass pulse, sounding faintly ominous, but it\xe2\x80\x99s soon reborn in a palatable key. The record\xc2\xa0never settles into\xc2\xa0its unease. When a cuckoo clock heralds the hour, you notice the \xe2\x80\x9cboing\xe2\x80\x9d of its spring, a perfectly innocent technology.\xc2\xa0Jump-cuts splice the scenes into disjointed vignettes, but it feels less like psychic overload than the beguiling minutiae overheard by a baby between naps.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s intrigue lies in its prelinguistic response to a hyperactive world. \xe2\x80\x9cInvocation of a Midsummer Reverie\xe2\x80\x9d collages a furious scurry of warped raga drones, distressed whistling, and erratic tabla. It ought to overwhelm, but the music, often aglow with Cargill\xe2\x80\x99s warm synths,\xc2\xa0seems determined to\xc2\xa0witness mayhem with wide eyes rather than bloodlust. Even the faintly erotic skin-slapping sequence\xe2\x80\x94with yelps and maniacal laughter\xe2\x80\x94takes on a dreamy, aqueous quality, as if it were part of an arcane meditative ritual.' b'Between the field recordings and concr\xc3\xa8te collage, moments of grand\xc2\xa0beauty waft out of the ether. Eleven minutes into \xe2\x80\x9cThe Harbinger of Spring,\xe2\x80\x9d an uneasy silence settles, then bursts into a celestial F-major 7th, scattering melodies\xc2\xa0like sunlight through cracked glass. More tamely rendered, the movement could transmit epic yearning, but its purpose here seems spiritual, admitting a sublime moment into the chaos. The group proceeds with irreverence\xe2\x80\x94groaning brass, whirring static-gusts, murmuring speech\xe2\x80\x94but can\xe2\x80\x99t disguise\xc2\xa0the air of sanctity.' b'Throughout Children of Alice, intermittent flute lines evoke the alien, swannee-whistle voices of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Clangers,\xe2\x80\x9d the strangely poignant late-\xe2\x80\x9960s TV show that encouraged kids to imagine \xe2\x80\x9cless fortunate stars\xe2\x80\x9d than Earth, where life \xe2\x80\x9cmight be very different, very bleak and dull.\xe2\x80\x9d Our fond nostalgia for the show feels somehow bound to its creepiness\xe2\x80\x94slightly too-long silences, eerily calm\xc2\xa0narration\xe2\x80\x94which is\xc2\xa0the hauntologist\xe2\x80\x99s bread and butter. But Children of Alice\xc2\xa0is different from its predecessors. Its nostalgia\xc2\xa0feels less escapist than therapeutic, and its composure amid the mundane\xc2\xa0and deranged is more of a\xc2\xa0promotion for\xc2\xa0mindfulness. Unlike Broadcast, there\xe2\x80\x99s no friction here between their daydreams and our reality; those worlds collapse into one, harmoniously intertwined. From its soundworld\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0small terrors rises something unterrifying, a mis-en-sc\xc3\xa8ne\xc2\xa0too lovingly rendered to haunt.'"
b'Elucid',7.5,b'Valley of Grace',0,b'Rap',b'March 13 2017',"b""The underground New York rapper's noisy, corroded new mixtape is also uniquely attuned to melody and song structure. It's thoughtful, spiritual, and above all, ambitious.""","b'When he was growing up, Chaz Hall\xe2\x80\x99s parents dragged him to church every Sunday\xe2\x80\x94back-to-back services in the morning, and a third after a brief reprieve at Old Country Buffet. At some point, he started skipping dinner, slinking to the back of the sanctuary, teaching himself how to operate the equipment at the mixing board. Soon he was recording himself, alone in a empty room.' b'Over the course of the aughts, Hall\xe2\x80\x94aka Elucid\xe2\x80\x94embedded himself in the labyrinthine world of underground rap in New York. His music can be difficult to find: much of it came out under short-lived or one-off artist names, as collaborations with producers, other rappers, or both. But in the past few years, Elucid\xe2\x80\x99s name has come to the forefront, both as a solo artist and as one-half of the duo Armand Hammer, with his Backwoodz Studioz label mate, billy woods.' b'Elucid\xe2\x80\x99s music can also be difficult, or at least seem unapproachable. It\xe2\x80\x99s full of knotty, dense writing and supremely technical passages. Yet unlike plenty of underground rappers (and major-label artists, for that matter), he\xe2\x80\x99s uniquely attuned to melody and song structure. Even when he breaks convention, his intent seems to be clear; his delivery is an intoxicating blend of the gruff and guttural and something more melodic. His LP from last year, Save Yourself, was a collage of heartbreak and ambition that takes dozens of listens to properly unpack; it grappled with love, gentrification, and the corrosive nature of religious institutions.' b'His latest work, a half-hour dispatch called Valley of Grace, has songs titled \xe2\x80\x9cself care is a revolutionary act\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstrength is admired humanity is denied.\xe2\x80\x9d Where Save Yourself\xc2\xa0was in certain ways inextricable from New York (Elucid has made camp in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere over the last couple of decades), Valley of Grace was written and recorded in Johannesburg and Cape Town, and taps into something more ethereal. It\xe2\x80\x99s thoughtful, considered, and among the most ambitious rap records to come out this year.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cColonizers corpse,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, sounds straightforward and up-tempo, but is written in a way that throws Elucid into a series of scenes where the spiritual stakes keep increasing: at first, roadside vendors are running after escaped chickens with cleavers, later a \xe2\x80\x9cgunned-down\xe2\x80\x9d child\xe2\x80\x99s soul runs with the same desperation. He ends the song with \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-appointed poet laureate of the Niggerati/hard copy/I am not my body,\xe2\x80\x9d allowing those words to give way to forty seconds of ear-splitting distortion that open the next track before hopping back in: \xe2\x80\x9cWatching America burn from distant shores/I learned to walk hot coals before I left the East coast.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Valley also features some of Elucid\xe2\x80\x99s most adventurous production: see \xe2\x80\x9ctalk disruptive for me,\xe2\x80\x9d which sounds like the climaxes of three different movies played on top of one another. \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99d rather be a cyborg than a goddess,\xe2\x80\x9d which accounts for fully one-third of the tape\xe2\x80\x99s running time, flits back and forth between (and occasionally merges) cold, industrial textures with warmer tones, the latter coming via very lo-fi samples.' b'Along with frequent appraisals of America\xe2\x80\x99s current state and deeply entrenched hypocrisy on race, the topic that Elucid returns to most is the state of his body. From the hot coals under his feet to the \xe2\x80\x9cclear and present danger\xe2\x80\x9d to his physical form (\xe2\x80\x9cno release\xe2\x80\x9d), Valley of Grace frequently feels, by its very existence, like an act of defiance. Perhaps he says it best himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no prisoner/Your indifference and silence speaks volumes/I pray the wrath of my ancestors surrounds you.\xe2\x80\x9d With this record, Elucid has taken sharp, maximalist writing, music that\xe2\x80\x99s very nearly avant-garde, and distilled each down to its core elements.'"

It helped define the future of jazz and the mind of Monk.""","b'The summer of 1957 would seem to mark the redemption of Thelonious Monk, the summer he made\xc2\xa0Monk*\xe2\x80\x99s Music\xc2\xa0*in one night.' b'He was then a 39-year-old New York jazz pianist of great repute who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to work at most jazz clubs in New York for the past six years. His\xc2\xa0cabaret card, a relic of New York law enforcement since prohibition, had been revoked in 1951 after a spurious narcotics charge. And so he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy to see, which means he might have seemed elusive. He was introverted and sometimes guarded; such behavior has never been unusual in jazz. In fact he lived with bipolar disorder\xe2\x80\x94undiagnosed at the time, though we know about it now, especially through the work of the scholar Robin D.G. Kelley, whose book\xc2\xa0Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times\xc2\xa0of an American Original*\xc2\xa0*is the principal source of much biographical information here.' b""At the end of 1955, Monk\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Barbara, had died. In early 1956, an electrical fire destroyed his New York apartment on West 63rd Street, totaling his piano and resulting in his family of five, basically destitute, having to stay for months with friends\xe2\x80\x9415 people in a three-room apartment. At the beginning of 1957, Monk spent three weeks in Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, taken there by a policeman he'd been unresponsive to after a car accident. (What else was going on in his bloodline? Kelley\xe2\x80\x99s book, at this period, contains a chilling sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cThelonious did not know that his own father had been living in a mental asylum for the past fifteen years.\xe2\x80\x9d) In May, his wife Nellie developed an illness which resulted in a thyroidectomy, leaving her frail and depressed, which had a relay effect on Monk. Also during this time, Monk got himself a manager, began a close musical relationship with John Coltrane, made several albums for Riverside records including\xc2\xa0Monk*\xe2\x80\x99s Music,\xc2\xa0*regained his cabaret card, and started a six-month job at the Five Spot Caf\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x94a gig which would re-establish his performing career, serve as Coltrane\xe2\x80\x99s finishing school, and be described thereafter as a high point in New York jazz culture."" b'This is all a relatively easy story to tell. There is a reversal of fortune; Monk makes a great album; he wins. Like any cliche, it only applies badly to Monk.' b'As a pianist, Monk, who would have turned 100 this year, was not a dazzler-virtuoso like Art Tatum or Oscar Peterson. He phrased in a wide circumference around the beat, leaving a lot of silence in an improvisation, enough for you to notice. He made polytonal clonks on the keyboard by playing the desired note as well as the key adjacent to it. The assumption, often, was that either he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much technique, or was withholding it because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be understood or known too quickly, and why would someone do that?' b'A common initial reaction to Monk was skepticism. The pianist Randy Weston, then 18, first saw Monk playing in Coleman Hawkins\xe2\x80\x99 band. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is this cat on piano?\xe2\x80\x9d Weston remembers thinking, in his memoir\xc2\xa0African Rhythms.*\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI can play more piano than this guy!\xe2\x80\x9d In other words:\xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99*s unclear what this person knows.\xc2\xa0Another reaction was humility. The drummer Art Blakey described in a 1973 interview how Monk had been his sympathetic guide through what Blakey called the \xe2\x80\x9ccliques\xe2\x80\x9d in New York jazz when Blakey first arrived from Pittsburgh in the early \xe2\x80\x9940s. Blakey watched Monk defend his own music and insist on the right way to play it. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very outspoken,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knew what he wanted to do, and he did it.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words:\xc2\xa0this person knows a lot.' b'Much of the talk around jazz, and around Monk, turns on ideas of knowing and not-knowing. (I keep the hyphen, as for related reasons did Donald Barthelme in his essay of that name\xc2\xa0as well as various Buddhists and psychotherapists, because by \xe2\x80\x9cnot-knowing\xe2\x80\x9d I mean flexibility, working without a fixed outcome, trusting oneself to find a new vocabulary, as opposed to what I would mean without the hyphen: ignorance, lack of awareness, incuriosity.) By one understanding, jazz is a consensual language of rhythm, harmony, and form, and a consensual repertoire accumulated over the last hundred years. That\xe2\x80\x99s about knowing. If you want to work in jazz, you have to get the basic songs under your fingers. Those songs\xe2\x80\x94including, say, \xe2\x80\x9cAll the Things You Are,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDonna Lee,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFootprints,\xe2\x80\x9d and about ten by Thelonious Monk\xe2\x80\x94are a part of what holds the tradition together.' b'The larger part is the fact that jazz is essentially African-American in musical vocabulary and disposition. Jazz is cultural memory. For many African-American musicians, to know is also to be aware of the values and dangers; to know is not to forget. Monk\xe2\x80\x99s music suggested the cumulative past as a wider present: something older from within jazz\xe2\x80\x94boogie-woogie or early Ellington\xe2\x80\x94along with other vernacular traditions adjacent to it: rumba, gospel, or rhythm and blues.' b'Jazz is further defined by the discipline of improvising, which some say is an express-lane to thinking through time progressively and allowing possibility, the greater idea of not-knowing.' b'***' b'From the first seconds of \xe2\x80\x9cWell, You Needn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d the second track on\xc2\xa0Monk*\xe2\x80\x99s Music\xc2\xa0*and the record\xe2\x80\x99s greatest eleven minutes, much control is in evidence. You hear Monk, with only the bassist Wilbur Ware thrumming in the back, working upward from the C below middle C over an F pedal in half-steps: C, Db, D, Eb, E. Monk is playing in an implied three-beat rhythm, and punching out his notes a little roughly, as you might imagine yourself punching an elevator button. But he is doing it in between the beats, with style and purpose. He climbs his five notes twice, each time bringing you one step away from resolution in a perfect cadence; he is building tension and expectation in a classical and idiomatic way, alerting you that something is going to take place here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an\xc2\xa0event. Then it arrives: the song\xe2\x80\x99s hard opening, with John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins and the rest of the septet piling in, Art Blakey\xe2\x80\x99s drumming shoving it forward.' b'The band plays the theme together and Blakey crashes on its last beat. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s Monk\xe2\x80\x99s turn. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start until the cymbal quiets down, and so for the first measure and a half there is silence. His solo begins as a restatement of the song\xe2\x80\x99s melody, according to convention, but picks it up like a sentence started in the middle. He speeds up and slows down, experimenting, stamping his foot a little, testing the strength of the rhythm and his own relationship to it. Three times he brings his hand down on a strange five-note chord: a stack of fourths, all black notes. Each time he lets it ring for six beats. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, You Needn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d was not a particularly famous song in 1957\xe2\x80\x94Monk had recorded it ten years before for Blue Note, also with Blakey\xe2\x80\x94but it sounds colossal here.' b'*' b'Monk wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an album artist per se. Monk*\xe2\x80\x99s Music\xe2\x80\x94produced by Orrin Keepnews, recorded at Reeves Sound Studios on East 44th Street,\xc2\xa0released on Riverside Records\xe2\x80\x94is contradictory: strident, reassuring, fractured, centered. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, whatever perfect means. Here and there it sounds like a rehearsal or a jam session. Some solos wander, particularly on \xe2\x80\x9cEpistrophy,\xe2\x80\x9d and the trumpeter Ray Copeland and alto saxophonist Gigi Gryce are comparatively weak links. But\xc2\xa0Monk\xe2\x80\x99s Music\xc2\xa0also\xc2\xa0sounds loose and deep and urgent. At its best it suggests a party in a specific room; you come to know the room. After Monk finishes his solo in \xe2\x80\x9cWell, You Needn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouts \xe2\x80\x9cColtrane! Coltrane!\xe2\x80\x9d to signal who\xe2\x80\x99s up next. Ravi Coltrane, John\xe2\x80\x99s son, told me that when he first heard\xc2\xa0Monk\xe2\x80\x99s Music\xc2\xa0*he was 21, listening in a university library with headphones on. At Monk\xe2\x80\x99s shout, he startled, thinking someone was looking for him.' b'The band includes the saxophonist John Coltrane, Monk\xe2\x80\x99s new student, who sounds dry, driven, searching; the saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, Monk\xe2\x80\x99s old mentor, with a gallant and knowing affect that he puts to special use on Monk\xe2\x80\x99s ballad \xe2\x80\x9cRuby, My Dear\xe2\x80\x9d; and Blakey, a kind of younger brother, pro-active, explosive, rendering the dance impulse in super-titles. Monk himself does nothing strange by his own standards. He is brusque and vatic and intimate, moving through funny, orderly, supremely affective songs. The first track is the exception in several ways: it is only a melody, played in straight rhythm by the horns alone; it is a hymn called \xe2\x80\x9cAbide With Me,\xe2\x80\x9d also known as \xe2\x80\x9cEventide,\xe2\x80\x9d composed in the middle of the 19th century by the English composer William Henry Monk. Destiny\xe2\x80\x99s Child liked to put their gospel songs at the end of their records; Monk put his at the beginning.' b'Monk*\xe2\x80\x99s Music\xc2\xa0*includes the first renderings of a harmonically rich song that would become one of Monk\xe2\x80\x99s standards, \xe2\x80\x9cCrepuscule With Nellie,\xe2\x80\x9d written for his wife at a fragile time. Monk plays it unnervingly slowly, and bids the band to do the same with him. (One of his drummers at the time, Frankie Dunlop, in an interview from 1984 extraordinary for the secret knowledge about rhythm it reveals, as well as for Dunlop\xe2\x80\x99s imitation of Monk\xe2\x80\x99s speaking voice, called Monk\xe2\x80\x99s approach to tempo \xe2\x80\x9ca different musical category altogether.\xe2\x80\x9d) Really, it\xe2\x80\x99s a radical slow dance. During the Five Spot gig, while others soloed, Monk began the practice of dancing on stage: a soft lurch, turning in a circle, imitating the greater circle around the beat.' b'*' b'A lot came together for Monk in 1957. Shortly thereafter, starting in the 1960s, he shifted up to touring theaters with a steady band. His records became elegantly repetitive and often staid. He appeared on the cover of *Time *magazine in 1964; from then on, till his withdrawal from playing in the 1970s and his death in 1982, he was \xe2\x80\x9cknown.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'You can make fun of jazz writers from the distant past all day, but some of their early published ideas about Monk in the \xe2\x80\x9940s, especially in\xc2\xa0Down Beat*\xc2\xa0*and\xc2\xa0Metronome, were only as na\xc3\xafve as Weston\xe2\x80\x99s. If they liked him, they were describing a European-style avant-garde hero, desiring to cut loose from the known. If they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like him, they were describing music they found incomplete or antisocial. They described him as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo too,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfor the super hip alone,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cneurotic,\xe2\x80\x9d and\xe2\x80\x94worst of all\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cbad, though interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d All these reactions imply Monk\xe2\x80\x99s fecklessness or lack of control. They are the reactions of people encountering a critical intelligence and not knowing what to do with it.' b'Monk\xe2\x80\x99s story is a story of relationships. Born in Rocky Mount, NC, he grew up among Southern and Antillean families at 234 West 63rd Street in Manhattan, on a block now called Thelonious Monk Circle. A couple doors down, No. 224, was the Columbus Hill Neighborhood Center, his social hub and the site of his early gigs. His engagement in the jazz culture of Harlem through the \xe2\x80\x9940s, alongside Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, and Kenny Clarke, created several new languages in jazz, collectively and roughly described as bebop. All his interviews, all the anecdotes, illustrate that Monk, to a great degree, knew his own value and had no interest in being strange on purpose. (\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the word \xe2\x80\x98weird,\xe2\x80\x99 anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Nat Hentoff.) He knew who he was, and that knowledge allowed him the freedom of not-knowing.' b'One of the best lines in Kelley\xe2\x80\x99s book comes in a secondhand story told by the poet Ted Joans. Be skeptical, but here it is. At some point in the second half of 1957, during a set at the Five Spot, Monk wandered off stage as the band continued to play, out the doors of the club, and walked for a few blocks. One of the club owners chased him down and found him looking at the sky. He asked Monk if he was lost. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t lost. I\xe2\x80\x99m here,\xe2\x80\x9d Monk is said to have responded. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Five Spot\xe2\x80\x99s lost.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
b'Fleetwood Mac',8.7,b'Tango in the Night',1,b'Rock',b'March 11 2017',"b""Tango in the Night is the final album the band would record as an infamous quintet.\xc2\xa0It's a pop and production masterpiece,\xc2\xa0yet remains this\xc2\xa0monolithic, lucrative idea of a Fleetwood Mac record.""","b'It started with \xe2\x80\x9cSara.\xe2\x80\x9d The first two Fleetwood Mac albums to feature Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks\xe2\x80\x94the self-titled album and Rumours\xe2\x80\x94featured production typical of the pop-rock generated in Los Angeles in the \xe2\x80\x9970s. They were professional and pristine, exhibiting an instrumental and emotional warmth that was, in terms of the actual recording technique and the cerebral atmosphere of the people making the records, a product of isolation. On their next record, Tusk, Buckingham shifted the balance of Fleetwood Mac\xe2\x80\x99s studio pop. He deliberately produced his songs so that they sounded trebly and makeshift\xe2\x80\x94as if they were translated from brain to tape as quickly as possible\xe2\x80\x94and produced Nicks\xe2\x80\x99 and Christine McVie\xe2\x80\x99s songs with a lush and carefully-sculpted dimensionality. \xe2\x80\x9cSara,\xe2\x80\x9d a song Nicks wrote to a daughter she never had, is so gently shaped that every instrumental and vocal materializes in the song like vapor in the atmosphere. At the Blockbuster Music Awards in 2001, Nicks said that when she writes songs, she tries to \xe2\x80\x9cmake little worlds\xe2\x80\x9d for the listener. Whether intentional or not, this sensibility invaded Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s production of the song; \xe2\x80\x9cSara,\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears on Tusk, is its own world, a complete environment, a beach house built out of sighs.' b'The follow-up to Tusk, 1982\xe2\x80\x99s Mirage, was a kind reflexive scaling back; both Warner Bros. and Buckingham wanted to regenerate the success and the coherent atmosphere of Rumours. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t take. The band members had already drifted too far from each other: Nicks sang country-western and synth-pop songs; Buckingham quoted Pachelbel\xe2\x80\x99s Canon; McVie\xe2\x80\x99s formal romanticism began to take on a crystalline quality; the production flowed in the direction of their individual fascinations. After a brief tour, the band went on hiatus. Nicks released two successful solo albums; McVie and Buckingham put out one each. In 1985, Buckingham had begun work on an additional solo album, when Mick Fleetwood suggested Buckingham fold his new songs into the more monolithic, more lucrative idea of a Fleetwood Mac record.' b'The resulting album, Tango in the Night, is exactly that: a monolithic, lucrative idea of a Fleetwood Mac record. It was recorded over eighteen months between 1986 and 1987, mostly at Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s home studio in L.A. Buckingham devoted himself to the record, laboring intensely over its songs, its sounds, and the integrity of its design. Recording technology had advanced substantially since the early \xe2\x80\x9980s, and Buckingham found the methods by which he could determine the shape and temperature of a Fleetwood Mac song had expanded.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost of the vocal parts were recorded track by track,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the *New York Times *in 1987. \xe2\x80\x9cThe voices used in the textured vocal choirs were mostly mine. I used a Fairlight machine that samples real sounds and blends them orchestrally.\xe2\x80\x9d Out of these newly available materials, he could practically build an entire band, which was useful at the time. Mick Fleetwood was almost entirely consumed by his cocaine habit, and the band had been experiencing an internal drift for years. \xe2\x80\x9cConstructing such elaborate layering is a lot like painting a canvas and is best done in solitude,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckingham added.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s artwork, \xe2\x80\x9cHomage a Henri Rousseau\xe2\x80\x9d by Brett-Livingstone Strong,\xc2\xa0is so\xc2\xa0lush and romantic that it walks a fine line between formal elegance and kitsch, blending the terrestrial with the celestial. It\xe2\x80\x99s an accurate illustration of Tango in the Night\xe2\x80\x99s sound design, of the glitterings and humid shimmers that Buckingham placed in the songs. He made each track on Tango just as he produced \xe2\x80\x9cSara\xe2\x80\x9d: less an arrangement of bass, guitar, drums, and vocals than a complete world, a living panorama. There\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenal wholeness to the recordings on Tango that seems like a superficial compensation for how deeply fragmented the band was at the time.' b'After Nicks resurfaced from her cocaine addiction at the Betty Ford Clinic, she visited Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s studio for a few\xc2\xa0weeks. Three of her recordings figure into the finished Tango, only two of which were written by her. Her voice, invariably hoarse after years of cocaine abuse, often warps or fails the already incomplete material. She howls her way through \xe2\x80\x9cSeven Wonders,\xe2\x80\x9d a song written mostly by Sandy Stewart. (Nicks receives credit because she misheard \xe2\x80\x9cAll the way down you held the line\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cAll the way down to Emmiline\xe2\x80\x9d; for Nicks\xe2\x80\x94and I don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree\xe2\x80\x94sometimes accident and authorship are indistinguishable.) For all of its bluster, the song is not only enhanced by the incidents of its arrangement but is the incidents of its arrangement; try to imagine the song without its synth hook and hear the rest of it evaporate. On \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I See You Again,\xe2\x80\x9d Nicks\xe2\x80\x99 voice almost crumbles and shatters into atoms. \xe2\x80\x9cStevie was the worst she\xe2\x80\x99s ever been,\xe2\x80\x9d Buckingham told Uncut in 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize her...I had to pull performances out of words and lines and make parts that sounded like her that weren\xe2\x80\x99t her.\xe2\x80\x9d Fittingly, each verse and chorus that Nicks sings sounds generated by a different uncanny assemblage of Stevie, among them one who sings in a kind of mutilated whisper. After the bridge, Nicks completely disappears. Buckingham finishes the song.' b'Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s songs on *Tango *are less knotted than they were on Tusk and Mirage, newly permissive of space. The first single, Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBig Love,\xe2\x80\x9d is a song that inadvertently simulates the essential failure of the album. It is devoted to a totally abstracted and imaginary form of love, while Tango in the Night is devoted to a totally abstracted and imaginary form of Fleetwood Mac (neither of which could be assembled in reality). The song\xe2\x80\x99s arrangement feels austere and detached, a byproduct of the narrator\xe2\x80\x99s alienation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also decorated with overlapping, pointillist guitar phrases. Even the empty spaces on Tango feel like deliberately-wrought emptinesses\xe2\x80\x94for instance, the airy synths that hover over the verses of McVie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d or Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s title track, which through its sense of space imparts the feeling of rowing through fog and mystery.' b'Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s McVie whose work is most realized by Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s impressionism. Her \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere\xe2\x80\x9d is the best song on the record. Like \xe2\x80\x9cBig Love\xe2\x80\x9d it too is about encountering an idea too big to contain within oneself (love, again). But where \xe2\x80\x9cBig Love\xe2\x80\x9d apprehends it with icy suspicion, \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere\xe2\x80\x9d responds with warmth, empathy, and buoyancy, describing a kind of devotion so deeply felt that it produces weightlessness in a person. Its incandescent texture is felt in almost any music that could be reasonably described as balearic. Elsewhere, \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t It Midnight,\xe2\x80\x9d McVie\xe2\x80\x99s co-write with Buckingham and her then-husband Eddy Quintela, seems an inversion of the values of \xe2\x80\x9cEverywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d a severe \xe2\x80\x9980s guitar rock song that gets consumed by a greater, more unnerving force by its chorus, as if it\xe2\x80\x99s succumbing to a conspiratorial dread. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the face of a pretty girl?\xe2\x80\x9d McVie sings, and Buckingham echoes her in an unfeeling monotone (\xe2\x80\x9cthe face of a pretty girl\xe2\x80\x9d) while behind him synths chime in a moving constellation, UFOs pulsing in the dark.' b'This is the essence of Tango in the Night: something falling apart\xc2\xa0but held together by an unearthly glow. More of a mirage than Mirage, it is an immaculate study in denial (its most enduring hit revolves around McVie asking someone to tell her \xe2\x80\x9csweet little lies\xe2\x80\x9d). It\xe2\x80\x99s a form of dreaming where you could touch the petals of a flower and feel something softer than the idea of softness. In this way, Tango seems to emerge less from Buckingham\xe2\x80\x99s pure will and imagination than from a question that haunts art in general: How can one make the unreal real, and the real unreal?' b'The remaster of Tango in the Night isn\xe2\x80\x99t as topographically startling as last year\xe2\x80\x99s Mirage, where new details seemed to rise out of the mix as if in a relief sculpture; it sounded good on CD in 1987. The reissue does sound warmer and brighter, and the instruments feel less digitally combined, which lifts background elements to the surface, like the seasick drift of the bass notes in \xe2\x80\x9cCaroline\xe2\x80\x9d and the coordinated staccato harmonies in the title track. The reissue also includes two discs of b-sides, demos, and extended remixes, several of which were previously unreleased. \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Kind of Love\xe2\x80\x9d is described as a demo but sounds like a completely developed Buckingham song, gentle and simple, with every edge expressively filigreed; it could\xe2\x80\x99ve been a potential second sequel to \xe2\x80\x9cYou and I.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSeven Wonders\xe2\x80\x9d appears in an earlier, more relaxed arrangement, with Lindsey\xe2\x80\x99s guitar warmly swanning between the notes that would eventually be reconstructed in perfect digital isolation by a synthesizer.' b'The demos also reveal the ways in which the songs could fold into and out of each other. On the \xe2\x80\x9cTango in the Night\xe2\x80\x9d demo you can hear Buckingham, at the edge of every chorus, begin to invent the trembling choral part that opens \xe2\x80\x9cCaroline.\xe2\x80\x9d Nicks\xe2\x80\x99 eventual solo track \xe2\x80\x9cJuliet\xe2\x80\x9d is present in two of its primordial forms\xe2\x80\x94as the instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cBook of Miracles\xe2\x80\x9d (credited to both Buckingham and Nicks) and as a five-minute \xe2\x80\x9crun-through.\xe2\x80\x9d The run-through is especially curious, reducing \xe2\x80\x9cBook of Miracles\xe2\x80\x9d to a formulaic blues-rock over which Nicks\xe2\x80\x99 voice produces a just-barely musical static, full of wobbles and distortions and exclamations. After the take she says, ecstatically, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was wonderful! I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play! I did not play because I am so smart!\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Nicks exhibits a strange, dissonant giddiness in this moment that isn\xe2\x80\x99t present in any of the band member\xe2\x80\x99s memories of the recording process. At the time, in his interview with the Times, Buckingham imaginatively described Tango in the Night as a restorative process. \xe2\x80\x9cThis album is as much about healing our relationships as Rumours was about dissension and pain within the group,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe songs look back over a period of time that in retrospect seems almost dreamlike.\xe2\x80\x9d Twenty-six years later, Buckingham summarized the experience to Uncut in more severe terms: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was done with the record, I said, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my God. That was the worst recording experience of my life.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The jealousy and resentment he felt toward Nicks for the success she experienced in her solo career, and the prevailing feeling that his architectural work on the band\xe2\x80\x99s records went unnoticed and unappreciated, had built to a flashpoint. Later in 1987, the band met up in anticipation of the promotional tour for Tango, for which they had already secured dates and signed contracts. At the meeting, Buckingham announced he was quitting the band. \xe2\x80\x9cI \xef\xac\x82ew off of the couch and across the room to seriously attack him,\xe2\x80\x9d Nicks told Classic Rock in 2013*.* \xe2\x80\x9c...I\xe2\x80\x99m not real scary but I grabbed him which almost got me killed.\xe2\x80\x9d They spilled out of McVie\xe2\x80\x99s house and into the street. Buckingham ran after Nicks and threw her up against a car. She \xe2\x80\x9cscreamed horrible obscenities\xe2\x80\x9d at him, and he walked away, from the moment and the band. What\xe2\x80\x99s left, after these harsh fragments of reality are swept away, is Tango in the Night: a remarkably complete album, a lavish garden growing out of negative space. Just a dream.'"

This website\xe2\x80\x99s review for his staggering 2010 debut, Marcberg, refers to him as \xe2\x80\x9ca rapper associated with Busta Rhymes\xe2\x80\x99 Flipmode Squad,\xe2\x80\x9d a descriptor that was barely reductive at the time. Roc Marciano the person\xe2\x80\x94that would be the 39-year-old Rakeem Calief Myer\xe2\x80\x94comes from Ed Koch\xe2\x80\x99s New York, a place that informs his work by way of syntax, slang, and a catalog of grainy samples that sound like they were lifted out of rainwater. It gave him train-rattling drums, too, but lately he\xe2\x80\x99s been stripping those away.' b'The character that Marci has created on wax, the one with Isaac Hayes shades and Kevin McHale-colored fishscale, has been everywhere: Burkina Faso, Venezuela in his best dress clothes, chubby on a sunny beach, his gun in reach. Rosebudd\xe2\x80\x99s Revenge, the long-awaited proper follow-up to 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Reloaded, carries each piece of his style toward the extreme, which makes this his most confounding, and maybe his most singular work to date.' b'Impressive as it is on a formal level, Rosebudd\xe2\x80\x99s Revenge also raises interesting questions about the inner workings of Marci\xe2\x80\x99s mind. On \xe2\x80\x9cGunsense,\xe2\x80\x9d he raps: \xe2\x80\x9cMotherfucker, this is art, you can\xe2\x80\x99t just pick this apart/This not a hobby, this is therapy.\xe2\x80\x9d Those lines, defiant as they are, would be unremarkable coming from any number of rappers. But Roc Marciano records seldom feel like confessionals, at least in any recognizable sense; you don\xe2\x80\x99t picture a pimp slumping into his therapist\xe2\x80\x99s couch to talk about how flying in shooters from Jamaica makes him feel.' b'Marci\xe2\x80\x99s trafficking in something more circuitous than a linear line from trauma to psychic baggage. Unlike his longtime collaborator, Ka\xe2\x80\x94who appears here on the excellent \xe2\x80\x9cMarksmen,\xe2\x80\x9d and whose own solo work also explores just how lean New York can sound\xe2\x80\x94Marci doesn\xe2\x80\x99t write in monologue. Instead, he tends to stack images on top of one another, building it higher and higher until it can scrub blood off of Nikes or get the mink out of storage. See \xe2\x80\x9cAlready,\xe2\x80\x9d where he raps, \xe2\x80\x9cMahogany woodgrain all in the five-speed/Silk lay on me, pray for me/Eight million stories in the naked city/The humidity\xe2\x80\x94it made the titties oil.\xe2\x80\x9d Later on the same song, he says that his jeans fit him like Springsteen, that his shoes cost as much as an MF DOOM verse, and \xe2\x80\x9cFans demand new work, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a man of few words.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'In each and every case, the point of view is slippery enough that you\xe2\x80\x99re never quite sure who the speaker is, how literally a line should be taken, and whether its connection to subsequent lines is superficial, deeply important, or altogether non-existent. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to answer any of these questions to appreciate Marci\xe2\x80\x99s Technicolor virtuosity. to follow him to murder scenes in Wichita (\xe2\x80\x9cPimp Arrest\xe2\x80\x9d) or to Israeli\xc2\xa0hotel rooms (\xe2\x80\x9cBetter Know\xe2\x80\x9d). But answering them might help to bridge the gap between Rakeem Myer and Roc Marciano\xe2\x80\x94to see which of his too-vivid details are things he aspires to and which he sees as necessary evils.' b'As a writer, Marci\xe2\x80\x99s gift is his ability to make evil seem impossibly slick; on \xe2\x80\x9cBurkina Faso,\xe2\x80\x9d he ends an armed robbery by telling his victim, \xe2\x80\x9cKeep the Dunks, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a hipster,\xe2\x80\x9d then heads home and listens to Michael Bolton in the jacuzzi. Rosebudd\xe2\x80\x99s Revenge isn\xe2\x80\x99t as seamless as Marcberg or Reloaded, suffering from some fidelity issues and perhaps being a bit back-loaded, but it\xe2\x80\x99s endlessly, almost impossibly entertaining. Even as he approaches middle age, Marci remains one of rap\xe2\x80\x99s most brilliant stylists, the kind of artist who can make you wear out your rewind button despite being old enough to remember when you could wear out a rewind button.' b'Maybe the most aspirational line on the record is: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just having fun with this, I live in comfort.\xe2\x80\x9d For all the death threats, all the cartoon luxury that Marci rattles off with a sneer, the underlying truth is that he\xe2\x80\x99s a master technician who\xe2\x80\x99s worked tirelessly, for years on end to hone an unmistakable style as a rapper, producer, and auteur. Maybe the most peaceful thing he can imagine\xe2\x80\x94the beach where he can get chubby, as it were\xe2\x80\x94would be fading back into the ether, content to know that after years of obscurity, he became one of the greatest, most influential rappers of the decade.'"

While Power\xe2\x80\x99s prior work offered\xc2\xa0the possibility of meditative headphone listening or even dancefloors, \xe2\x80\x9cRhesus Negative\xe2\x80\x9d is awesome\xc2\xa0in the most literal sense, meant to paralyze with both admiration and fear.' b'But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like\xc2\xa0an endurance test\xe2\x80\x94instead, the brickwalled production of \xe2\x80\x9cRhesus Negative\xe2\x80\x9d recalls industrial-arena monoliths like Nine Inch Nails\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cWish\xe2\x80\x9d or Cold Cave\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Pan Is Dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Like anything under the Fuck Buttons or Blanck Mass names, *World Eater *is suitable for casual listeners who have some curiosity for extreme music and a decent pain threshold. The difference here is that Power looks back on the past decade of electronic music and finds how *all of it *is capable of showing the kind of domineering aggression that people might only otherwise get from Fuck Buttons, heavy metal, or Tunnel bangers.' b'World Eater evokes\xc2\xa0everything\xc2\xa0from his own up-with-people breakout single \xe2\x80\x9cBright Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d to\xc2\xa0Purity Ring\xe2\x80\x99s EDM-indie, from witch house\xc2\xa0to the trap music populating millions of SoundClouds and Vegas nightclubs. The undulating, pitched-down vocals and skittering drum patterns of \xe2\x80\x9cPlease\xe2\x80\x9d bear the echo of Holy Other and any number of Tri Angle acts, though it sounds murderous rather than haunted. It\xe2\x80\x99s a rare instance of *World Eater *showing menace and finesse rather than brute strength. Similarly, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rat\xe2\x80\x9d runs \xe2\x80\x9cRock n\xe2\x80\x99 Roll Pt. 2\xe2\x80\x9d through TNGHT\xe2\x80\x99s blown subwoofers.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSilent Treatment\xe2\x80\x9d is Power going \xe2\x80\x9cPOWER,\xe2\x80\x9d chopping a choir into a war cry and\xc2\xa0weaving it through a labyrinthian grid of footwork-inspired percussion.' b'Just about anything is going to be interpreted as an act of protest in 2017. On World Eater, the coexistence of melody and belligerence, of fragility under an invincible veneer, speak to the constructive and destructive capabilities of man. Power is completely honest about which instinct is winning right now. Nearly every reference on World Eater\xc2\xa0sounded utopian at one point, and had the album\xc2\xa0been released during a less turbulent time, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rat\xe2\x80\x9d could have feasibly been used for the London Summer Games alongside Fuck Buttons\xe2\x80\x99 own \xe2\x80\x9cOlympians.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0World Eater does not seem\xc2\xa0like\xc2\xa0a doomsday device by design, though.\xc2\xa0It might sound like one now, but Power leaves open the possibility of it being his darkest transmission before the dawn of a *new *bright tomorrow.'"
b'Jos\xc3\xa9 James',7.3,b'Love In a Time of Madness',0,b'Jazz',b'March 11 2017',"b""On his fourth album for the Blue Note label, James deftly underlines jazz's flexibility in relation to new pop trends, the way Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis did in the past.""","b'Modern jazz fans have a right to feel possessive about the singer Jos\xc3\xa9 James. In the last decade, he\xe2\x80\x99s been one of the suavest vocal improvisers on the scene. His 2015 album devoted to songs made popular by Billie Holiday, Yesterday I Had the Blues, sounded to me like the most soulful tribute to come out during Lady Day\xe2\x80\x99s centennial.' b'Steeped as he is in jazz, James has also shown a restlessness with strict genre categorization. He\xe2\x80\x99s described his love of funk, R&B and hip-hop in interviews. And when Blue Note announced his new album, the label\xe2\x80\x99s press release bore a striking quote from the artist: \xe2\x80\x9cI could make jazz albums the rest of my life, but I want to reach people, man. I like Jamie xx as much as I like Miles Davis, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d' b""You could practically hear the well-drilled corps of Jazz Defenders grinding their teeth in response. But on this new record, James doesn't discard his old skill set. He\xe2\x80\x99s merely doing his part to underline the music\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility in relation to new pop trends\xe2\x80\x94much as Louis Armstrong and Davis himself did in decades past. (Clive Davis once wrote that Davis asked Columbia to stop labeling him as a \xe2\x80\x9cjazz man.\xe2\x80\x9d)"" b'James knows all about this history. And so does Blue Note. So while there are indeed trap-music snares in a few songs on Love in a Time of Madness, there are also plenty of James\xe2\x80\x99 more typical textures. On opening track \xe2\x80\x9cAlways There,\xe2\x80\x9d a\xc2\xa0stark synth line\xc2\xa0presents a useful contrast with the light-touch smoothness of James\xe2\x80\x99s baritone. During\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCloser,\xe2\x80\x9d he responds to a looped, low-pitch sample by cutting back on melodic filigree\xe2\x80\x94save for a brief escape, on the line \xe2\x80\x9cshow you I can be the only one.\xe2\x80\x9d In the context of the song, it\xe2\x80\x99s a standard line about romantic prowess. At the level of arrangement, it reminds the listener that James has more to offer when singing over a rhythmic grid.' b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re dead cold to trap beats or the dolorous mood of the Weeknd\xe2\x80\x99s R&B, the subtle but real changes James works on these styles won\xe2\x80\x99t be radical enough to win your affection. But there might be something else for you here, since the core strength of Love in a Time of Madness is its range of dance-pop appreciation. In the middle of the record, James includes a trio of songs that sound like an EP Prince could have produced for the Time in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s. Uptempo standout \xe2\x80\x9cLive Your Fantasy\xe2\x80\x9d contains call-and-response funk and the kind of synth chords Jamie Starr snatched from earlier waves of jazz fusion. \xe2\x80\x9cTo Be With You\xe2\x80\x9d is the sultry ballad. And on \xe2\x80\x9cLadies Man,\xe2\x80\x9d James flashes his newly drilled falsetto voice. Hewing this close to the Purple Formula is as risky as anything else James tries on the album, but he executes the play.' b'There are a couple of songs that simply assist us in identifying this set as a 21st-century pop-crossover record on Blue Note. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember Our Love\xe2\x80\x9d looks at a failed romance, and counsels sweetness. The downtempo \xe2\x80\x9cLet It Fall\xe2\x80\x9d has just a hint of social commentary, but stays tranquil. These are the most easily forgotten tracks. James initially envisioned Love as a double-album set, in which social themes could alternate with intimate ones. Even without the protest music, the 12-song version can sound as though caught between imperatives: eager to test the boundaries of a contemporary pop and jazz, but not ambitious enough in scale to do all the work the singer can envision. Still, he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly got the range to make a \xe2\x80\x9cbig statement\xe2\x80\x9d record seem plausible. If he can put everything together, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have more at his disposal than most singers in any tradition.'"
b'Jay Som',8.6,b'Everybody Works',1,b'Rock',b'March 10 2017',"b""Melina Duterte's careful, wise, and excellent album is the rare debut that expands the borders of a genre. It's not bedroom-pop because it sounds a certain way, but because it feels so intimate.""","b'Virtuous though it may be, patience is a difficult quality to capture in guitar rock, a medium that much prefers boldness, concision, and urgency. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s why Bay Area multi-instrumentalist Melina Duterte\xe2\x80\x99s reverence for the human capacity to wait and think and grow comes across as a revelation on Everybody Works, her first official album as Jay Som. \xe2\x80\x9cTake time to figure it out,\xe2\x80\x9d she advises on lead single \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bus Song.\xe2\x80\x9d In its context, she\xe2\x80\x99s caught between relationship statuses, assuring the object of her fixation that she\xe2\x80\x99ll \xe2\x80\x9cbe the one who sticks around.\xe2\x80\x9d As an introduction to an album full of reminders not to rush things, though, the line is a relief, enough to make you involuntarily exhale.' b'Bedroom pop is a genre designation that loses meaning by the year\xe2\x80\x94not just as technology creeps closer to erasing any distinction between studio production and home recording, but also as the musicians associated with it develop tastes more varied and less retro than, say, Ariel Pink\xe2\x80\x99s. Twenty-two-year-old Duterte made the fuzzy, dreamy, plaintive aesthetic her own on Turn Into, nine self-recorded tracks she uploaded to Bandcamp on a tipsy whim over a year ago and re-released with Polyvinyl in late 2016, billing the makeshift debut as a collection of \xe2\x80\x9cfinished and unfinished songs\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a proper album. Although she made *Everybody Works *alone in her bedroom studio, its repertoire ranges from folk to funk to chart pop. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a bedroom-pop album because it sounds a certain way, but because it feels so intimate. Most of Duterte\xe2\x80\x99s elaborate songs could be mistaken for full-band compositions, yet her preference for writing and recording in solitude imbues each one with an introspective quality.' b'Liberated from the obligation to conform to any one sound, Duterte investigates new styles with purpose. She\xe2\x80\x99s smitten with Carly Rae Jepsen\xe2\x80\x99s E\xe2\x80\xa2MO\xe2\x80\xa2TION, and it shows in the hooky choruses of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bus Song\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRemain,\xe2\x80\x9d two tracks steeped in exuberant longing. With its smooth keyboards and slinky bass line, \xe2\x80\x9cBaybee\xe2\x80\x9d comes on like an R&B slow jam, but instead of steaming up the windows, it\xe2\x80\x99s about seducing yourself into seeing your beloved through a rough patch: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I leave you alone/When you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel right/I know we\xe2\x80\x99ll sink for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Duterte coos\xc2\xa0on top of the music, like a layer of pure calm. \xe2\x80\x9c1 Billion Dogs\xe2\x80\x9d submerges anxious lyrics in a cloud of feedback that melds shoegaze, indie pop, and grunge as if it were a forgotten gem from the *DGC Rarities *compilation.' b'But the most arresting songs are the ones that defy categorization entirely. The first minute of the album, on \xe2\x80\x9cLipstick Stains,\xe2\x80\x9d sounds the way orchestra instruments might upon waking from an afternoon nap, blinking and stretching in the sunlight. When the vocals kick in more than halfway through the track, Duterte\xe2\x80\x99s murmur is just as drowsily blissful: \xe2\x80\x9cI like the way your lipstick stains/The corner of my smile,\xe2\x80\x9d she breathes. Everybody Works closes with \xe2\x80\x9cFor Light,\xe2\x80\x9d an epic, seven-minute ballad that transforms a whispered promise\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be right on time/Open blinds for light/Won\xe2\x80\x99t forget to climb\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94into a sing-along prayer by adding in the voices of backup singers. The mood of weary resilience is reminiscent of Nick Cave\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPush the Sky Away,\xe2\x80\x9d another album-closing message of encouragement that fully acknowledges the herculean effort it takes, sometimes, to merely keep going.' b'As that comparison suggests, Duterte has absorbed more of life\xe2\x80\x99s hard lessons than most of us do by age 22. The patience that suffuses *Everybody Works *doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 of a kid who\xe2\x80\x99s sure she has unlimited time to chase her ambitions and find love; it comes out of an emotionally mature view of relationships and the 10\xc2\xa0years of work she has already put into her songwriting, taking shitty jobs and enduring family strife to become the musician she is today. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll remain under your moon,\xe2\x80\x9d she pledges on \xe2\x80\x9cRemain,\xe2\x80\x9d an anthem of (perhaps one-sided) commitment. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody Works\xe2\x80\x9d registers Duterte\xe2\x80\x99s resentment at how easily success seems to come to the \xe2\x80\x9crock star\xe2\x80\x9d who make her wonder, \xe2\x80\x9cDid you pay your way through?\xe2\x80\x9d But empathy wins out in the end; she makes \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody works\xe2\x80\x9d a mantra, repeating the phrase as though to remind herself of the way other people\xe2\x80\x99s painstaking efforts can be invisible to us.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll of my songs are so different, but you know it\xe2\x80\x99s me,\xe2\x80\x9d Duterte remarked in a recent Pitchfork profile. She\xe2\x80\x99s right, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no better indicator that a songwriter has found her voice than the ability to explore new styles and still sound like the same artist. Just a few years into her adult life, and only one album into her recording career, Melina Duterte has swept past a milestone many musicians never even get in their sights.'"
b'Ed Sheeran',2.8,b'\xc3\xb7',0,b'Rock',b'March 10 2017',"b'Ed Sheeran sells trite innocence by the pound. He uses bland wisdom and unimaginative\xc2\xa0music to ponder the basic good and bad in people around him, without once looking inward.'","b'Ed Sheeran needs you to know that he did not go to university. Instead, he spent his teens slogging around the UK pub circuit, and by the age of 20, he was on his way to becoming Britain\xe2\x80\x99s biggest male pop star. Still, he likes to come back to the uni thing. He sings about not having a degree twice on his new album, \xc3\xb7, after at least three earlier instances in his catalog. He\xe2\x80\x99s fashioned this weighty chip on his shoulder into an arrow in his quiver, using it to shore up his everyman image and personable nature, while distinguishing himself as a bit of a cheeky system-shunning maverick who\xe2\x80\x99s made it this far on chops alone. His shtick is aspirational: All you need is free will, a little song in your heart, and perhaps you too could one day be playing for 270,000 people across three nights at Wembley Stadium.' b'Innocence is key to the Ed Sheeran brand. His self-proclaimed uncoolness is what makes him both cool and impervious to bad-tempered criticism. He regularly describes his true love as an angel, refers to his father\xe2\x80\x94a perpetually lingering prophet\xe2\x80\x94as \xe2\x80\x9cdaddy,\xe2\x80\x9d and sings tenderly about his grandparents. On \xc3\xb7\xe2\x80\x99s release day, he sold copies of his record in an HMV superstore, and looked indistinguishable from the full-time staff. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Sheeran is calculating, but then he told you as much in his album titles (\xc3\xb7, 2014\xe2\x80\x99s x, and 2011\xe2\x80\x99s +). Like Sia, the Chainsmokers, and Charli XCX, he marvels at his ability to turn out generic hooks like nobody\xe2\x80\x99s business\xe2\x80\x94so many, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even remember writing them when they hit No. 1 in 17 countries.' b'This is the genial, antiseptic frame through which we\xe2\x80\x99re to view Ed Sheeran. But considering he is among the most successful songwriters in the world, a lot of his lyrics do not even scan. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just a boy with a one-man show, no un-er-ver-si-tee..., just a song I wrote,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Do I Know?\xe2\x80\x9d like a teenage boy trying to knot a cherry stem with his tongue. When he raps, as he does on \xe2\x80\x9cEraser,\xe2\x80\x9d his words fit together with the elegance of Stickle Bricks. Good taste is of no concern: He lets John Mayer sleaze all over the tender ode to his girlfriend \xe2\x80\x9cHow Would You Feel? (Paean)\xe2\x80\x9d with his guitar. Although you can practically hear Rihanna\xe2\x80\x99s laugh after being offered the tropical house concession \xe2\x80\x9cShape of You,\xe2\x80\x9d the song generally fares fine until Sheeran, the seventh richest British musician under the age of 30, admits to his dating style: \xe2\x80\x9cYou and me are thrifty so go all you can eat/Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate/We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'There is no greater evidence of Sheeran\xe2\x80\x99s commercial power than his label acquiescing to keep Corrs tribute \xe2\x80\x9cGalway Girl\xe2\x80\x9d on this album. Set to bodhr\xc3\xa1n and uileann pipes, it\xe2\x80\x99s the latest of many Sheeran barnstormers about meeting a great gal (who is definitely real) on a boozy night out. A check from the Irish tourist board for him name-dropping Guinness, Jameson, John Powers, and Van Morrison may be forthcoming, which would certainly cover any forthcoming lawsuit from B*Witched for infringing on their 1998 hit \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x99est La Vie.\xe2\x80\x9d Sheeran traveled the world for a year before making this record, and considering his cultural takeaway from County Galway, we should be thankful his travels didn\xe2\x80\x99t also inspire him to write a song about lassoing une mademoiselle with a string of onions beneath the Eiffel Tower, or how love sprang eternal with a girl in a dirndl in Austria.' b'On his past records, Sheeran often painted himself as a drunken mess, at the mercy of bad girls and dark situations. Whatever you made of them, they felt, to use a dirty word, honest. Here, \xe2\x80\x9cEraser\xe2\x80\x9d feels like the only true reflection of his psyche, where he acknowledges his unrelatable predicament (\xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t nobody wanna see you down in the dumps/Because you\xe2\x80\x99re living your dream, man/This shit should be fun\xe2\x80\x9d). For the rest of the record, he switches to a mode of bland wisdom that allows him to ponder the good and bad in people around him rather than look inwards. The lack of honesty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter\xe2\x80\x94nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to Sheeran for gritty soul-searching. But the lack of imagination does. As with Adele, who was also told by Rick Rubin to go back to the drawing board, you suspect that more interesting songs may have been left off the record for commercial reasons.' b'If there\xe2\x80\x99s a personal touch to Sheeran\xe2\x80\x99s generic sentiments, it\xe2\x80\x99s his unwavering belief in love. He\xe2\x80\x99s often burned for it, he\xe2\x80\x99s desperate for kids, he sees the future in his girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Over the simpering groove of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Do I Know?\xe2\x80\x9d he talks about how his \xe2\x80\x9cdaddy\xe2\x80\x9d told him, \xe2\x80\x9cSon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you get involved in politics, religion or other people\xe2\x80\x99s quarrel.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, like a Disney woodland creature, he just wants to pass on \xe2\x80\x9cthe things my family\xe2\x80\x99s given to me: just love and understanding, positivity.\xe2\x80\x9d His feeble message falls apart when the self-confessed careerist sighs at someone surely in his same tax bracket for talking \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98bout exponential growth, and the stock market crashing and their portfolios/While I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sitting here with a song that I wrote.\xe2\x80\x9d Sheeran\xe2\x80\x99s conditional optimism flashes back into view, and shows his judgmental ass: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m all for people following their dreams/Just remember life is more than fit-tin\xe2\x80\x99 in your jeans,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, in a chummy, winking dig at the basic, vapid women who do not share his own basic, vapid worldview.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s one of several striking lyrics about appearances on \xc3\xb7, which is where the Nice Guy fa\xc3\xa7ade comes undone. Sheeran has always loved to neg and to position himself as an innocent victim. If you thought he\xe2\x80\x99d got all that out of his system when he co-wrote Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s risible \xe2\x80\x9cLove Yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d you were wrong. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cUnchained Melody\xe2\x80\x9d by way of Westlife, and a tender assurance to his beloved that she\xe2\x80\x99s not a mess, but a beauty. The barely suppressed creepiness of \xe2\x80\x9cHappier\xe2\x80\x9d is his attempt at post-breakup maturity, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even last into the next track, \xe2\x80\x9cNew Man,\xe2\x80\x9d a wounded sketch of his ex\xe2\x80\x99s new boyfriend who has \xe2\x80\x9chis eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwears a man bag on his shoulder but I call it a purse.\xe2\x80\x9d One nil, Sheeran. He turns his attentions to his ex. What happened to that sweet, sylvan girl who used to read and eat crisps by the river? \xe2\x80\x9cNow she\xe2\x80\x99s eatin\xe2\x80\x99 kale/Hittin\xe2\x80\x99 the gym/Keepin\xe2\x80\x99 up with Kylie and Kim.\xe2\x80\x9d You mean, when she could be listening to Sheeran rap about his daddy?' b""This is not to say that anyone should expect Sheeran\xe2\x80\x94who is popular at weddings and funerals for a reason\xe2\x80\x94to present a nuanced interpretation of gender politics within his songs (though his fans deserve more than depictions of women as angels or traitors). But more than his weak balladry, it's this disingenuous side that rankles. In the nostalgic vein of Lukas Graham\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c7 Years\xe2\x80\x9d and Drake\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWeston Road Flows,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheeran\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCastle on the Hill\xe2\x80\x9d yearns for a childhood idyll. It\xe2\x80\x99s pure sentimentality,\xc2\xa0another\xc2\xa0key to how he uses humblebraggadocio and innocence to shore up his moral high ground over shallow girls and unfair beauty standards. On \xe2\x80\x9cEraser,\xe2\x80\x9d Sheeran sings, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me.\xe2\x80\x9d He means booze and drugs, but it\xe2\x80\x99s his inability to reconcile his early underdog status with his titanic popularity that\xe2\x80\x99ll ensnare him. Sheeran wants it both ways: artist and celebrity, nice guy who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to alienate his fans with political convictions, anti-consumerist while gagging to dominate pop\xe2\x80\x99s arms race. He\xe2\x80\x99s the guy she told you not to worry about, and he\xe2\x80\x99s wearing your clothes."""

Over the course of six tracks that sparkle with classic Southern California funk and soul, the producer, just barely out of high school, offers up a dazzling number of musical ideas. Steve Lacy\xe2\x80\x99s Demo is all the more remarkable for the fact that most of the record was produced on an iPhone.' b'Lacy, 18,\xc2\xa0joined his school\xe2\x80\x99s jazz band in ninth grade, where he met Jameel Bruner, the younger brother of superstar bassist, Thundercat.

Lacy has classified\xc2\xa0Demo as a \xe2\x80\x9csong series\xe2\x80\x9d rather than an album or EP, a modesty belied by the fact that he has called the songs \xe2\x80\x9cperfect.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s not far off\xe2\x80\x94the music here is startlingly mature, full of dimension and depth, as if Lacy were accompanied by a full band rather than doing everything, right down to the mixing, by his lonesome. The opening song, \xe2\x80\x9cLooks,\xe2\x80\x9d kicks off with drums, adventurous bass, a wobbling synth, and gorgeous falsetto harmonies\xc2\xa0that lead in to the solitary verse. All those layers are in service of a song that\xe2\x80\x99s, of all things, a rejection of superficiality. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I got with you and turned out to be a total dick,\xe2\x80\x9d Lacy cautions. \xe2\x80\x9cWould you be happy \xe2\x80\x99bout that?\xe2\x80\x9d The song is all too brief\xe2\x80\x94it melts in your mouth before two\xc2\xa0minutes are up.' b'Talented musicians often lean on their chops, noodling at their instruments at the expense of tight songcraft. If anything, Lacy has almost the opposite problem: Many of the outstanding musical moments here feel teased rather than fulfilled. The verse that opens \xe2\x80\x9cRyd\xe2\x80\x9d could easily become a hook anchoring a full song\xe2\x80\x94instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s merely a bookend, a sliver of something great. But Lacy\xc2\xa0is so multitalented in his vocal range and his creative percussion (check the drums on \xe2\x80\x9cHaterlovin\xe2\x80\x9d), in his ability to wring soulfulness out of guitar and bass alike, that\xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to isolate one\xc2\xa0single element at which he most\xc2\xa0excels.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cDark Red\xe2\x80\x9d is the clear standout, the only song in which each part\xc2\xa0lingers for the appropriate amount of time. The swirling melodies on the chorus float atop the beat as a melodic counterpoint, an effect Lacy has said was influenced by David Longstreth\xe2\x80\x99s work with Dirty Projectors.\xc2\xa0And the aching quality of the music, complemented by the Motown harmonies that round out its back half, matches the song\xe2\x80\x99s theme, a plea lobbed at a partner who\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to turn away.' b'Despite its brevity,\xc2\xa0Demo is reminiscent of another auspicious debut, one that emerged more than 15 years ago. Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo had already made their mark as producers with the Neptunes, but their first\xc2\xa0album in\xc2\xa0the band NERD, In Search Of\xe2\x80\xa6**, was stronger and stranger than anything they had come up with before. And as\xc2\xa0its songs became cult classics,\xc2\xa0In Search Of... announced\xc2\xa0Pharrell as someone who could star in front of the camera, not just behind the boards. Steve Lacy\xe2\x80\x99s Demo evokes that record in its charisma and musical ability. Given that it\xe2\x80\x99s not even 15\xc2\xa0minutes, the record can\xe2\x80\x99t be said to be anything more than a particularly tasty appetizer. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the listener who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t yearn for the next course.'"

The French Press\xc2\xa0shines just as bright as their last EP, but the songs\xc2\xa0cast darker shadows.'","b'With their debut 2015 EP, Talk Tight, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever proved to be one of those special bands that arrives seemingly out of nowhere with a fully realized aesthetic. No tentative baby steps or half-formed experiments for this lot; Talk Tight\xc2\xa0exuded confidence and purpose, yielding five\xc2\xa0propulsive, jangly pop gems that felt instantly familiar. And its appeal was cross-generational. If you were raised on \xe2\x80\x9980s college rock, you could revel in nostalgic nods to the Feelies, the Clean, the Go-Betweens, and countless other Velvets revisionists. Younger fans\xc2\xa0could hear the sort of band the Strokes might have turned into had they aged more gracefully, or imagine what Real Estate might sound like after downing a case of Red Bull.' b'But while working from an old, dog-eared indie rock blueprint, the Melbourne band take great delight in redrafting the lines. With three distinctive singer-guitarists\xe2\x80\x94Tom Russo, Fran Keaney, and Joe White\xe2\x80\x94at the helm, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever don\xe2\x80\x99t operate so much like a traditional rock band as an improv theater troupe riffing on a pre-established theme. The locomotive rhythm may be locked in, but each member is free to ride it wherever they please. A Rolling Blackouts song rarely retraces its steps, often eschewing standard verse/chorus/verse structure for a parade of changing melodic motifs that are passed around the singers like hot potatoes. In the case of Talk Tight highlights like \xe2\x80\x9cClean Slate,\xe2\x80\x9d that meant you essentially got three great songs for the price of one.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a trick that (the now abbreviated) Rolling Blackouts C.F. still pull off with great aplomb on follow-up EP The French Press.\xc2\xa0Its six songs shine just as bright as those on Talk Tight, but they cast longer, darker shadows. You can sense the subtle change in temperament within the first 30 seconds of \xe2\x80\x9cFrench Press,\xe2\x80\x9d where the band work a taut motorik build reminiscent of Broken Social Scene\xe2\x80\x99s anxious anthem \xe2\x80\x9cCause = Time.\xe2\x80\x9d Taking full advantage of their Forster/McLennan-style dynamic, Russo and Keaney play the roles of brothers\xe2\x80\x94one traveling abroad, the other stuck at a miserable desk job\xe2\x80\x94as they try to converse over a patchy Skype connection. But as the song\xe2\x80\x99s incessant forward motion intensifies, the technological divide comes to symbolize the emotional one at the core of their relationship: \xe2\x80\x9cBrother don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Russo sings, \xe2\x80\x9cthat jealousy\xe2\x80\x99s a curse, and what\xe2\x80\x99s worse is the silence/Strange\xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re moving out of range.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrench Press\xe2\x80\x9d sets the tone for a record filled with seemingly innocuous scenes that suddenly turn tense. Even the songs that more readily evoke Talk Tight\xe2\x80\x99s carefree kicks\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cJulie\xe2\x80\x99s Place,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cColours Run\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94bound about at a more furious clip, powered by blurry-handed acoustic/electric strums liable to leave blood on the pick-ups. Just as Rolling Blackouts\xe2\x80\x99 music provides an instant sense of comfort through its \xe2\x80\x9980s indie-pop signifiers, lyrically, they make you feel right at home by dropping you in the middle of intimate scenes populated by first-name-basis characters. But that also means we\xe2\x80\x99re sometimes privy to conversations we\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to hear. Atop the twitchy twang of \xe2\x80\x9cSick Bug,\xe2\x80\x9d White\xe2\x80\x99s yearning reminiscence of an old flame (\xe2\x80\x9cI close my eyes to take you back/She touched my leg\xe2\x80\x9d) triggers a frantic torrent of \xe2\x80\x9cI want you! I want you! I want you! I want you!,\xe2\x80\x9d crystallizing that moment when the decorum of romance gets steamrolled by the indignities of desire.' b'Even as The French Press mellows out, it never really settles. The casual lope of \xe2\x80\x9cDig Up\xe2\x80\x9d puts a sunny, soft-focus filter on a portrait of a relationship\xe2\x80\x99s painfully slow demise (\xe2\x80\x9cThe walls are closing in all around us/I feel the moment\xe2\x80\x99s passing us by\xe2\x80\x9d). And the swooning, harmony-rich chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cFountain of Good Fortune\xe2\x80\x9d offers a precious taste of honey to chase Russo\xe2\x80\x99s bitter-pill critique of organized religion: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been washed, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been anointed/I\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten the body of the Lord/It\xe2\x80\x99s from the fountain of good fortune/Brings dirty, cloudy water/That pollutes the mind of anyone around.\xe2\x80\x9d Like Talk Tight, The French Press is brimming with vim, vigor, and open-road abandon. But what makes it an even more compelling listen is that, this time, we get a clearer glimpse in the rear-view mirror of the stressors they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to escape.'"

Only in this century has pop culture thawed to its Antarctic plot. The Thing is now perceived as a classic of the paranoid Reagan era, and since bombing in theaters, the movie has led to a comic book, amusement park ride, action figures, prequel, video game, and Hugo-nominated short story.' b'After years of operating on shoestring horror movie budgets, The Thing gave Carpenter approximately $15 million for its gory effects and blustery locations. It also meant that\xe2\x80\x94for the first time in a feature\xe2\x80\x94Carpenter didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to whip up his own score at the last minute. Unable to handle composing duties in addition to everything else The Thing required, Carpenter outsourced the music to the Maestro, Ennio Morricone.' b'Following decades of success in Europe and his iconic scores for spaghetti westerns, Morricone was only just making inroads into Hollywood. Despite having hundreds of credits to his name, Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s scores remain instantly recognizable, be they the yips of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the stinging surf guitars of Danger Diabolik, or the romantic orchestral swells of The Mission. Watching the film when it screened at BAM a few years ago, it was startling when Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s name emerged on the credits for The Thing\xe2\x80\x94so minimal, restrained, and atmospheric is his score.' b'Waxwork goes all out with this deluxe vinyl reissue of The Thing, an exquisite package, right down to a breakaway \xe2\x80\x9cice\xe2\x80\x9d slipcase. But those hoping to hear the telltale bum-bum that thuds throughout the film and chills the blood might be perplexed at first\xe2\x80\x94those were instances where Carpenter and his frequent collaborator Alan Howarth added extra cues, and don\xe2\x80\x99t emerge until late in the soundtrack. Instead, this reissue opens with Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHumanity (Part 1),\xe2\x80\x9d a gossamer motif on violin and harp that appears nearly 20 minutes in, which then edges into a more foreboding low-end. It\xe2\x80\x99s a stark piece, one as compositionally cold as the Antarctic landscape itself.' b'Revisit the film, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the extra patina of electronics that remains most foreboding\xe2\x80\x94the slow drones that make the skin prickle. (Cue the Thing\xe2\x80\x99s arachnid emergence in the dog kennel and tossing a flare onto the tentacular Bennings, for instance.) At times, though, Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s themes sound like the alien himself attempting to recreate Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s iconic analog synths. The relatively unmemorable \xe2\x80\x9cShape,\xe2\x80\x9d with its bowed cello and brass, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring to mind a particular scene from the film\xe2\x80\x94nor does the frantic pizzicato of \xe2\x80\x9cContamination.\xe2\x80\x9d And the bombastic lurches of \xe2\x80\x9cBestiality\xe2\x80\x9d feel too pompous in the context of the minimalist film. Given that Morricone composed suites while only looking at an early rough cut of the film, it makes sense that his cues (some of which went unused) seem out of sync with the film\xe2\x80\x99s frigid aesthetic. Separated from Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s Antarctic imagery, Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s cues sound unfamiliar; one would be hard-pressed to recall their corresponding sequences.' b'Midway through, Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s themes strike a balance between acoustic, human sounds and cold electronics. The strings of \xe2\x80\x9cSolitude\xe2\x80\x9d oscillate between anxious and vertiginous. Keys twinkle like melting icicles on the electronic-tinged \xe2\x80\x9cEternity,\xe2\x80\x9d soon joined by a church organ line that seems to be perpetually in descent, ratcheting up the tension and creating a sense of the inevitable. A meandering synth piece, \xe2\x80\x9cSterilization,\xe2\x80\x9d shows Morricone not altogether comfortable mixing these two distinct palettes together.' b'Only on \xe2\x80\x9cHumanity (Part 2)\xe2\x80\x9d do those forlorn electronic throbs emerge, paired with a desolate theme across woodwinds. It\xe2\x80\x99s on this motif that the film\xe2\x80\x99s frost-tipped dread is most closely felt\xe2\x80\x94so it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that, after four minutes, it suddenly lurches back into an overstated organ theme. In emphasizing the seething electronics and excising all but crucial bits of Morricone\xe2\x80\x99s original score, Carpenter proved that his vision for the film remained intact. History has bore that out and, unlike this original soundtrack, such barf bag junk has now attained its rightful place as a frightful horror classic.'"

Sure, there are bike messengers that peddle weed packed in plastic jars and Russian mobsters who launder money through Coney Island auto-shops, but the kind of trap-house, dope-boy, Robin Hood archetype that still carries in cities like Atlanta has been wiped clean from tri-state folklore. This is undoubtedly a good thing\xe2\x80\x94entrepreneurial city teens today hustle fashion trends to ogling editors instead of baggies to scraggly addicts. But the shift has fossilized a certain kind of rap album, like The Notorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s debut\xc2\xa0Ready to Die, released in 1994. The lawlessness it describes\xe2\x80\x94robberies at gunpoint on the A train, open-air hand-to-hand crack deals on Fulton St., shootouts with the NYPD\xe2\x80\x94land unfathomably to most New Yorkers today. Young transplants and natives alike would rather hear old tall tales than experience anything near it firsthand; distinct from nostalgia, it's more like moving into a home where a murder occurred. The thrill is a combination of fear and gall, rooted in the security that the scene will likely never repeat itself."" b'But there may be something habitual in New York\xe2\x80\x99s craned gaze backward. Note that B.I.G. opened Ready to Die by complaining about changes in the city around him over 20 years ago. Even then, the album was a reflection: an over-the-top, fisheye union address of the city\xe2\x80\x99s waning crack era, and a reeling admission that something must have gone terribly wrong for it to have happened. Its intro maps B.I.G\xe2\x80\x99s life against the sounds of various eras\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9970s \xe2\x80\x9cSuperfly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9880s \xe2\x80\x9cTop Billin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9890s Doggystyle\xe2\x80\x94before the 21-year-old launches into \xe2\x80\x9cThings Done Changed,\xe2\x80\x9d an opening monologue that sets the chaotic scene. Life used to be about funny hairstyles, curbside games, and lounging at barbecues, he says, but \xe2\x80\x9cTurn your pagers to 1993,\xe2\x80\x9d and the story has taken an inexplicably dark turn. It goes unmentioned here, but hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s region of choice had changed too: New York\xe2\x80\x99s first generation of rap inventors had given way to the West Coast, so it\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. Dre\xe2\x80\x99s voice we hear between verses, dispatching from Compton. \xe2\x80\x9cThings done changed on this side,\xe2\x80\x9d the sample declares, a savvy appropriation that characterized a rise in violence across coasts, and a shift in sound that B.I.G. hoped to correct.' b'In 1992, \xe2\x80\x9ca whole lot of niggas want[ed] Big to make a demo tape.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99d been battling around Fulton St since he was 13, and was known in Bedford-Stuyvesant as a force, in music and otherwise. The demo he recorded, \xe2\x80\x9cMicrophone Murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d along with a few other cuts, made it\xe2\x80\x99s way to The Source\xe2\x80\x99s Unsigned Hype column, then influential in hip-hop\xe2\x80\x99s walled off media environment, and then to Bad Boy, where Sean \xe2\x80\x9cPuffy\xe2\x80\x9d Combs would sign him. But as the demo\xe2\x80\x99s opening line specified, it was only at the nudging of his close friends that he pursued music\xe2\x80\x94B.I.G. was splitting time between Brooklyn and Raleigh, where he\xe2\x80\x99d set up a profitable drug operation. When his record advance didn\xe2\x80\x99t land quickly enough, he went back to N.C. to pick up the slack, and Puffy called him, alternately begging and demanding the rapper stop hustling and return to New York, devoted to music for good. The day that he left, the Raleigh house he\xe2\x80\x99d operated out of was raided by police officers.' b'What made Christopher Wallace pop-palatable amid such a gruesome backdrop was his humor, personality, and wit. He was a gruff, neurotic alternative to the ice-cool Snoop Dogg: if Snoop had bitches in the living room till six in the morning, B.I.G. was getting paged at 5:46, wiping cold out his eye. If Cali crossed over with low-rider funk from Parliament, New York would ride on block-party boogie from Mtume. And if taut flows were giving way to languid hooks, B.I.G. would tighten everyone back up. \xe2\x80\x9cUnbelievable\xe2\x80\x9d was the antithesis of \xe2\x80\x9cJuicy,\xe2\x80\x9d a love-letter to underground rap radio shows like Stretch & Bobbito, and to anyone with an oversized Land Cruiser (another change to consider\xe2\x80\x94New Yorkers used to drive). \xe2\x80\x9cThose that rushes my clutches get put on crutches, get smoked like dutches, from the master\xe2\x80\x9d; you can hear the roots of \xe2\x80\x9cpunchline rap\xe2\x80\x9d forming in Big\xe2\x80\x99s puns and internal rhyme, and the ironic turns of phrase that kids like Cam\xe2\x80\x99ron would intensify years later: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I thought he was wack!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94Oh come, come, now, why y\xe2\x80\x99all so dumb now?\xe2\x80\x9d' b'At the time, the album was praised for its honest portrayal of the drug dealer\xe2\x80\x99s internal conflicts, as opposed to sunny glorification of gang violence imported from L.A. Songs like \xe2\x80\x9cEveryday Struggle\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSuicidal Thoughts\xe2\x80\x9d showed Big\xe2\x80\x99s depth, frequent references to his mother showed his rearing, and casual dropping of words like \xe2\x80\x9cplacenta\xe2\x80\x9d showed his coy love of language. B.I.G. was a smart kid that had (or liked) to do dumb things, the record suggested, itself a comment on the how genius gets sharpened when faced with obstacles, and an affirmation of rap as a platform for such genius to be realized, and monetized.' b'Despite its author\xe2\x80\x99s youth, *Ready To Die *shows its age with its production. The beats already paled in comparison to the high-definition score of Life After Death, B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s follow up album, and the tinny drums and swampy samples on tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cMe and My Bitch\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRespect\xe2\x80\x9d probably played better on cassette than they do on Apple Music. At the time of the album\xe2\x80\x99s release, more nimble producers were doing interesting work on neighboring albums\xe2\x80\x94one could say Illmatic dried everyone in New York up of their best material. The major tracks on Ready to Die\xc2\xa0had to be heavy-handed, and the filler was just an excuse to hear Big keep rapping. \xe2\x80\x9cBig Poppa\xe2\x80\x9d was inseparable from Ron Isley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBetween the Sheets\xe2\x80\x9d and snuck in a trendy, post-regional synth line that would perk up West Coast ears. The \xe2\x80\x9cOne More Chance\xe2\x80\x9d remix became a smash crossover hit; the original included on the album is expectedly disposable. Even strong exhibitions of songwriting like \xe2\x80\x9cThe What\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGimme the Loot\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94one a duet with Method Man, the other with himself\xe2\x80\x94are weighed down by loops from Easy Mo Bee, a dated producer who Puffy might\xe2\x80\x99ve been smart to have axed shortly after.' b'Which brings us to the true triumph in Ready to Die\xe2\x80\x94Sean Combs, who\xe2\x80\x99s been able to spot a dollar hidden in the most unlikely places ever since, finds proof-of-concept for New York hip-pop that can carry from street corners to school dances, with the right sonic contexts, visual branding, and occasional ad-libs, a formula he\xe2\x80\x99d apply to Mase, Shyne, and his own material thereafter. The sounds may have shifted, but the thesis remains: drug dealers have stories for days, and Americans want to hear them. We revere the salesman more than the politician, and B.I.G. could sell the hell out of the life he lived. Maybe not all that much has changed after all.' b''"

On \xe2\x80\x9cNiggas Bleed,\xe2\x80\x9d Big is a bagman sent to secure a large drug transaction, but his greed has him thinking about a double-cross: \xe2\x80\x9cI kill them all, I'll be set for life,\xe2\x80\x9d he imagines. He decides to call up his friend\xe2\x80\x94a flashy and hard-hearted cutthroat from the Southwest who was once featured on America's Most Wanted\xe2\x80\x94to partake in a heist that involves a female Puerto Rican hotel worker who used to be drug boss, and a Jamaican with long dreadlocks and a taste for Asian women. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tour de force\xe2\x80\x94a time-shifting tale that devotes a whole verse to the backstory of a murderous misfit straight from an Elmore Leonard short who substitutes kerosene for gasoline because \xe2\x80\x9cfuck it, it's flame-able.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b""But \xe2\x80\x9cI Got a Story to Tell,\xe2\x80\x9d the recount of an after-hours creep with an NBA player\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend that culminates in physical assault and robbery, may be the most absurd tale of the bunch, because it's reportedly true. \xe2\x80\x9cStory\xe2\x80\x9d highlights Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s gifts as a raconteur. Inside his braggadocio, cars are colored with verve: a \xe2\x80\x9ccherry M3\xe2\x80\x9d BMW, a \xe2\x80\x9cmarine blue 6 coupe\xe2\x80\x9d Mercedes, a \xe2\x80\x9cchampagne Range\xe2\x80\x9d Rover. For his fictional tales, names and locales are doled out like characters in hardboiled pulp fictions: \xe2\x80\x9cArizona Ron from Tuscon,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGloria from Astoria,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDarkskin Jermaine\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cnearly lost half his brain over two bricks of cocaine, getting his dick sucked by Crackhead Lorraine.\xe2\x80\x9d But, when it comes to the truth, he's shy on specifics. No names, no states, no boroughs, or other signifiers are mentioned. When pressed by his friends as to the identity of the cuckold, he brushes it off: \xe2\x80\x9cOne of them 6' 5\xe2\x80\x9d niggas\xe2\x80\x94I don't know.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b""Double albums tend to be overblown, self-indulgent cash grabs, but Life After Death warranted the approach. Beginning with the 1994 Quad Studios shooting of Tupac Shakur in New York City, the Notorious B.I.G\xe2\x80\x94along with Combs, Shakur, and Suge Knight\xe2\x80\x94was at the center of a multifaceted rivalry. It was a struggle between N.Y.'s Bad Boy and L.A.'s Death Row records that surpassed label affiliation to become about coastal loyalty, arguments about commercialism vs. art that spread from the music industry to the public, whispers of motives and allegiances ran from the streets to the urban criminal underworld. Big easily had more than one album's worth of material to talk about."" b""Not only did he have more drawn on, he had more ways to talk about it than anyone else. More than anyone one else in rap ever, Big was able to break language and bend syntax to speak about things in ways that were unforeseen yet seemingly unavoidable in hindsight: \xe2\x80\x9cAt last, a nigga rappin' 'bout blunts and broads, tits and bras, m\xc3\xa9nage \xc3\xa0 trois, sex in expensive cars, and still leave you on the pavement,\xe2\x80\x9d he rapped on the No. 1 radio single \xe2\x80\x9cHypnotize.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cCondo paid for, no car payment. At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff, 'Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement.' Face it: not guilty\xe2\x80\x94that's how I stay filthy.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b""Big was a master of flow, sounding unforced and unlabored over a bevy of pristine, hi-fidelity maximalist beats that seemed to always bow to his intent. His voice was that of a gentle giant; a sumo ballerina who could deashi and pas de bourr\xc3\xa9e, henka and plie. Few terms in any tongue can capture the way Big was light on his words while heavy on thought. He made his slams look like pirouettes even over the most grating pop moves like \xe2\x80\x9cMo Money Mo Problems,\xe2\x80\x9d which showcased Combs' predilection for turning \xe2\x80\x9880s R&B hits into \xe2\x80\x9890s rap tunes\xe2\x80\x94a push and pull between producer and artist that remains unmatched in hip-hop to this day."" b""This infamous tug between Combs' pop predilections and Big\xe2\x80\x99s gully tendencies is all over Life After Death: the way the sequencing goes from the Herb Alpert-sampling \xe2\x80\x9cHypnotize\xe2\x80\x9d to DJ Premier's Screamin' Jay Hawkins chop on \xe2\x80\x9cKick in the Door\xe2\x80\x9d to a boudoir ballad with the R. Kelly-assisted \xe2\x80\x9cFuck You Tonight\xe2\x80\x9d to black glove tough talk with The Lox on \xe2\x80\x9cLast Day\xe2\x80\x9d to lavish ballerism on the Ren\xc3\xa9 & Angela remake \xe2\x80\x9cI Love the Dough\xe2\x80\x9d with Jay Z. It's a wrenching of the ridiculous that Big wins at every turn by being on \xe2\x80\x9cthat Brooklyn bullshit\xe2\x80\x9d on \xe2\x80\x9cHypnotize\xe2\x80\x9d; by making \xe2\x80\x9cFuck You Tonight\xe2\x80\x9d unprofitable without a heavily-edited radio version; by squeezing so many words and skillful mispronunciations and imagery like wearing precious stones \xe2\x80\x9cin beards and mustaches\xe2\x80\x9d into \xe2\x80\x9cI Love the Dough.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b""Despite being 24 cuts deep, the album never wears on\xe2\x80\x94the quick twists, deep moods, dark humor, and mastered artistry more than hold your attention. But, still: Like even a good movie, you're ready for it to end when it ends, and it climaxes with songs that deliver on the promise of the era of conflict (and death and rage and extremism) that surrounded Big in 1997. Due to his assassination 20 years ago on March 9th, the last three songs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cMy Downfall,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLong Kiss Goodnight,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cYou're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills You)\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94were never enjoyed by the public at large while Big was alive. Today, it's almost impossible to hear them as anything other than war songs for the dead and those about to die. These numbers are both a declaration of intent and pauses for remorse; clarion-song and elegy alike, heavy instrumentation for the trenches and pews, all hymnals of well-earned paranoia and odes to a dawn of violence."" b""And, though the ending is undoubtedly full of salvos from a reluctant warrior, there's a glimmer of hope that says that the young heart of Christopher Wallace from Bed-Stuy\xe2\x80\x94not the Notorious B.I.G. from Bad Boy\xe2\x80\x94was still beating beneath all that armor. On \xe2\x80\x9cYou're Nobody,\xe2\x80\x9d he's mingling with \xe2\x80\x9cthorough bitches\xe2\x80\x9d who rode around in a fruit-colored two-door Acura and\xe2\x80\x94in a telling, but coded move\xe2\x80\x94he hearkens back to the determined aspiration of his breakthrough hit \xe2\x80\x9cJuicy,\xe2\x80\x9d rapping his perceived future into existence: \xe2\x80\x9cAs my pilot steers my Lear,\xe2\x80\x9d he drops seemingly apropos of nothing but rhyme and boast. But, looking deeper, further back, past the blood on his friend's sneaker from the opener, you recall how this all began:"" b'He was sitting in the crib, envisioning Learjets, visualizing coupes, lusting the way Salt \xe2\x80\x9cshooped,\xe2\x80\x9d and wanting to sell records like Snoop Dogg. Big may not have been around to see it, but he saw it before it happened. He created an alternate reality and lived it until his death and after.'"

Wu-Tang Clan\xe2\x80\x99s Ol\xe2\x80\x99 Dirty Bastard\xc2\xa0made a beeline for the stage, beating Colvin to the mark. He appeared suddenly in front of millions in a brand new maroon suit, delaying her acceptance speech to protest Puff Daddy\xe2\x80\x99s earlier Best Rap Album win for his debut, No Way Out, which defeated the Clan\xe2\x80\x99s Wu-Tang Forever and The Notorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x99s posthumous Life After Death. Bad Boy had dominated the rap Grammys that evening with wins in two of the three categories, landing nominations in each one, and scoring seven nominations total. Puffy, Faith Evans, and 112 were all winners. Biggie and Mase were both nominees. ODB had enough. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how y\xe2\x80\x99all see it, but Wu-Tang is for the children,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPuffy is good, but Wu-Tang is the best.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The scene is among the most memorable images in Grammy history, despite the fact that the rap Grammys themselves were not televised that year. As if getting the last laugh, two new Bad Boy collaborations were in the Hot 100 Top 20 when the charts went live three days later: Puffy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBeen Around the World\xe2\x80\x9d with Mase and Biggie and Mase\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with fellow Bad Boy signee Total, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat You Want.\xe2\x80\x9d The week underscored a key point about the label then: despite its opponents and skeptics, Bad Boy Records was a machine, and all it did was win.' b""Bad Boy's near-sweep at the Grammys capped a year of successes for the hit factory and for Puffy, who dominated the charts, the clubs, and the award ceremonies. But those fleeting highs were sullied by a far greater loss: the murder of Christopher Wallace. The specter of death hangs eerily over No Way Out, through near prescient verses delivered by Biggie from beyond the grave (\xe2\x80\x9cNiggas wanna hit me, if they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani\xe2\x80\x9d) and reflective odes bared by those living in the aftermath of his slaying. Puff explores paranoia, grief, and self-awareness in the wake of losing a dear friend, an icon at the peak of his powers. It's\xc2\xa0an album as much about celebrating and surviving as it is mourning, but more than anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s a label compilation that bound its participants together, one marked by a refusal to stop winning\xe2\x80\x94even when under the gun."" b'When Biggie was shot and killed in a drive-by weeks before the release of his sophomore album, it instantly made the Bad Boy modus operandi obsolete. They were a posse built around a transcendent star. Everything revolved around Biggie. He appeared in several Bad Boy videos. He appeared on singles and notable tracks for Craig Mack, Total, and 112. He was their face. He was the brand. In the long term, his death would create a power vacuum in rap Mecca\xe2\x80\x94starting a turf war between would-be kings like Nas and Jay Z\xe2\x80\x94but the immediate aftershock was felt more subtly within his camp, which was searching for a way to sustain without one of the most heavily felt presences in all of popular music. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter Big died, we were searching to see who was gonna carry the torch,\xe2\x80\x9d Mase remembered in GQ\xe2\x80\x99s oral history of the Bad Boy run. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody would\xe2\x80\x99ve had the right to get out of contracts because of the violence. Instead, we rolled together. If I had a verse or beat that was better for you, I\xe2\x80\x99d just give it up.\xe2\x80\x9d Mase\xe2\x80\x99s verses for No Way Out were written in his Harlem bedroom long before he was signed. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave them to Puff, because he was the one with the hot hand.\xe2\x80\x9d Starting with Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s Mase-featuring smash \xe2\x80\x9cMo Money Mo Problems,\xe2\x80\x9d Puff\xe2\x80\x99s hot hand would continue to deal hits at an unprecedented rate.' b'By \xe2\x80\x9997, Sean \xe2\x80\x9cPuffy\xe2\x80\x9d Combs had already established himself as one of the finest producers and talent scouts in the country. After cornering the rap market with Big and Craig Mack (with Mase and the LOX waiting in the wings), he diversified into R&B, signing new acts like 112, Total, Mario Winans, and Carl Thomas. He executive-produced Mary J. Blige\xe2\x80\x99s My Life and co-produced Usher\xe2\x80\x99s self-titled debut, and he scored credits on TLC\xe2\x80\x99s CrazySexyCool. Along with his in-house production team, the Hitmen, he cut records for everyone from Jodeci to Mariah Carey to Aretha Franklin. Not long before his death, Biggie convinced Combs to try his hand at rap, and with his team surrounding him production began on Puffy\xe2\x80\x99s debut. Taking the name Puff Daddy, he would adopt an uber glamorous image, helping to coin the term \xe2\x80\x9cghetto fabulous.\xe2\x80\x9d Combs wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a naturally gifted rapper by trade, but he had remarkable taste and a clear vision. His Bad Boy bio, shared in a \xe2\x80\x9898 Vibe story, exposed his solo rap career as merely a means to further his roles as a premier impresario and tastemaker in true Puffy fashion: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not an MC,\xe2\x80\x9d it read. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a vibe giver.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'In January \xe2\x80\x9996, Puff Daddy set the tone for No Way Out with the Mase-featuring single \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t Nobody Hold Me Down,\xe2\x80\x9d a body-roll-friendly jam that heavily sampled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Message.\xe2\x80\x9d The video was a crash course in \xe2\x80\x9cnew money\xe2\x80\x9d extravagance\xe2\x80\x94silk pajamas, pristine white jumpsuits, action movie pyrotechnics, Eddie Griffin, driving through the desert in a drop top Rolls Royce, rapping about rocking Versace and Hawaiian getaways. The album was originally headed in a fun, glitzy direction, in the vein of \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t Nobody Hold Me Down\xe2\x80\x9d and the forthcoming single \xe2\x80\x9cBeen Around the World.\xe2\x80\x9d But Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death caused Puffy to redo half the album, creating a party record spotted with bouts of depression and sorrow; coupling words from the deceased with remembrances of his life and the impact of his passing. \xe2\x80\x9c[The album\xe2\x80\x99s] more serious now than when I first got into it,\xe2\x80\x9d Puffy told SPIN that September. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are still days where I just wake up and feel like I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this anymore. But it\xe2\x80\x99s become a situation in which I have no choice. This is what I do. I have no way out.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""No Way Out is a living document of the most tumultuous period in Bad Boy\xe2\x80\x99s run. It embodies the complex mix of emotions felt while persevering through great trauma amid triumph. It's\xc2\xa0a record that splits itself in two trying to capture a gaudy lifestyle and the devastation of loss all at once, equal parts funeral pyre, signal fire, and beach luau. One minute they\xe2\x80\x99re jet-setting around the globe with Big in tow, the next Puff is alone peeking over his shoulder for armed assailants, contemplating his final hour. Samples of Marvin Gaye\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIf I Should Die Tonight\xe2\x80\x9d and New Edition\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIs This the End?\xe2\x80\x9d become vehicles for distress and alarm, as he prepares his last will and testament. But a song like \xe2\x80\x9cI Got the Power\xe2\x80\x9d reestablishes control: \xe2\x80\x9cI be\xc2\xa0that nigga that yo niggas can\xe2\x80\x99t fuck wit,\xe2\x80\x9d he raps. \xe2\x80\x9cThat nigga that'll die for his main man/That nigga with the gettin' money gameplan.\xe2\x80\x9d For its somewhat whiplashing nature, everything the album does is packaged neatly, spotlighting Puff as its star while exalting a slain legend and comrade and reassuring Bad Boy culture stockholders that the remaining roster was ready to carry the mantle. This is the all-conquering rap debut of a production and marketing guru."" b'With production from the Hitmen aces\xe2\x80\x94Puffy, Stevie J, D-Dot, and Amen-Ra, in particular\xe2\x80\x94and a host of talented role players, namely Big\xe2\x80\x99s widow Faith Evans, his mistress Lil Kim, the star-to-be Mase, The Lox, and more, No Way Out crafted a near perfect Bad Boy time capsule, capturing the label\xe2\x80\x99s highs and lows of \xe2\x80\x9897. From the agony of \xe2\x80\x9cPain\xe2\x80\x9d to the celebrity-critiquing \xe2\x80\x9cDo You Know?,\xe2\x80\x9d it chronicles every natural reaction to Big\xe2\x80\x99s shooting dutifully and without fully compromising Puffy\xe2\x80\x99s Bad Boy mission statement: make feel-good music that tops the charts.' b""Puff Daddy proves himself to be a more than capable leading man, talking his shit with supreme confidence one minute and humbling himself at the altar of his fallen friend the next. He\xe2\x80\x99s among the most believable boasters in rap history\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cYou ain\xe2\x80\x99t gotta like me, you just mad/\xe2\x80\x98Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be,\xe2\x80\x9d he raps on \xe2\x80\x9cVictory\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and he\xe2\x80\x99s his own best hype man who\xe2\x80\x99s equally enthusiastic stumping for others. But for the most part, No Way Out pivots on its exceptional Biggie cameos. His aura lingers. There\xe2\x80\x99s a slickness to his bars that\xe2\x80\x99s unparalleled, that fills up all the surrounding space with brio. He makes a seam-splitting Jay Z verse seem pedestrian (\xe2\x80\x9cYoung G\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d) and brings half the fun to \xe2\x80\x9cBeen Around the World\xe2\x80\x9d with his goofy rendition of Lisa Stansfield's \xe2\x80\x9cAll Around the World.\xe2\x80\x9d On the slow-building \xe2\x80\x9cVictory,\xe2\x80\x9d he trades verses with Puff, backing his play. (The song\xe2\x80\x99s final verse, the last Big ever recorded, is believed to be a reference track for Puffy.) The remix to \xe2\x80\x9cAll About the Benjamins,\xe2\x80\x9d a chief among posse cuts once deemed by XXL the second best rap song of the \xe2\x80\x9990s, is among the last truly great artifacts of the Bad Boy era: the perfect blend of varying personalities and top notch performances all winding around the same axis: Biggie and the mutual appreciation of stunting."" b'\xe2\x80\x9cStatistically, this was one of the best years of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Puffy told Rolling Stone in December \xe2\x80\x9997, \xe2\x80\x9cbut personally, it was one of the worst. I would rather not have this. I would do anything\xe2\x80\x94I would turn the hits into negative hits if I could just be with Biggie again.\xe2\x80\x9d Biggie was gone, though, and the hits kept coming. Puff Daddy\xe2\x80\x99s first two singles topped the charts and his next two peaked at No. 2. No Way Out set the stage for Mase\xe2\x80\x99s hugely successful debut Harlem World later that year, and the next year it was the LOX\xe2\x80\x99s turn. As the run continued and the accolades kept mounting, Puffy became rap\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected celebrity executive, notching more No. 1\xe2\x80\x99s than any rapper in history to that point. But there\xe2\x80\x99s something singular about No Way Out, which somehow feels like both a cautionary tale and an affront to mortality: The Notorious B.I.G. had been assassinated by his enemies, but his legacy was eternal. The album remembers him, not as man but as myth.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s something fascinating about following a song as mournful and self-serving as \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Missing You\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which turns \xe2\x80\x9cAdagio for Strings\xe2\x80\x9d and the Police\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEvery Breath You Take\xe2\x80\x9d into a rousing eulogy with Puff and Big at its center\xe2\x80\x94with a song as triumphant as \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t Nobody Hold Me Down.\xe2\x80\x9d The transition seemed to build the strength necessary to overcome tragedy. With or without Biggie, their superstar and genius, the Bad Boy machine would continue to roll. Nobody\xe2\x80\x94not even the ghost of an all-time great\xe2\x80\x94could hold Sean Combs down. When the dust settled and No Way Out was on its way to going septuple platinum, SPIN ran a January \xe2\x80\x9898 feature titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mourning After,\xe2\x80\x9d taking stock of the post-Biggie Bad Boy climate and wondering at what point public grieving became shameless promo. \xe2\x80\x9cMarketable mourning,\xe2\x80\x9d as Sia Michel called it, contributed at least in part to the ongoing sales spike. Martyrdom is misery porn for some. But No Way Out is more than just the commissioning of lifeless tributes or some flagrant attempt to merchandise tragedy; it\xe2\x80\x99s an attempt to do the most difficult thing in adversity\xe2\x80\x99s wake: keep going.'"

It\xe2\x80\x99s the first project bearing his name that was conceived, produced, and completed after the Brooklyn icon had gasped his last breaths. By now, rap fans are deeply familiar with this baleful, unlovely creature\xe2\x80\x94the posthumous collection of reworked demos, outtakes, and leftovers cobbled together by executives and hired guns, paired with a list of guest artists and of-the-moment producers. They reek of boardroom meetings. They usually fill you with a hollow, complicit feeling for even hitting \xe2\x80\x9cplay.\xe2\x80\x9d It is hard to think of five such records in pop-music history that justify their existence after their first-week sales figures have posted.' b""In the two years since Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s death, his mentor and corporate svengali Puff Daddy had already found several ingenious ways to siphon cash and attention from his dead prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Puffy's solo album, long in the works, was retitled No Way Out from working title Hell Up In Harlem and overhauled after Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s death, emerging full of gothic dread and intimations of ready-to-die-ness. Its biggest single was his Police-sampling, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll Fly Away\xe2\x80\x9d-interpolating \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Missing You,\xe2\x80\x9d a maudlin tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. that spent 11 weeks at No. 1."" b'The following year, he released the debut album from The Lox, a hardheaded trio of Yonkers rappers with a deafening street buzz. Puff decked them in shiny suits and dropped them in front of Hype Williams\xe2\x80\x99 fish-eye lens, where they looked about as comfortable as middle schoolers stranded at prom. The album included the less-heralded, equally maudlin tribute, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll Always Love Big Poppa.\xe2\x80\x9d In the video, baby-faced Jadakiss, Sheek Louch, and Styles P poured their hearts out to their dead friend, while Puff Daddy stood behind them, pointing meaningfully at the camera. It was clear that whatever Puff thought of the grief process, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see much need to keep it behind closed doors.' b'Somewhere in there came the announcement for Born Again. Initial reports promised a sort of Biggie bildungsroman, pairing narration from Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s mother Voletta Wallace with unheard demos and unreleased material. Rap listeners had been busily copping and sharing Biggie exclusives from a steady stream of mixtapes, freestyles and unfinished cuts dating back to 1993, but those traveled in rarefied circles, and the idea of a studio album bringing this stuff to the masses was enticing. But the story changed quickly, and often; a full-page ad in the September \xe2\x80\x9899 issue of The Source promised some intrigue, including a track\xc2\xa0that would posthumously reunite Biggie and 2Pac and a\xc2\xa0new remix of \xe2\x80\x9cParty & Bullshit\xe2\x80\x9d that foretold an appearance from Will Smith. For better or for worse, this never came to pass, and what ended up being released was a jumble of some older, less well-known verses and some recycled material from already-available releases.' b'Born Again wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s story. Sure, it spawned one or two lasting cuts: the flashy, Duran Duran-sampling \xe2\x80\x9cNotorious B.I.G.\xe2\x80\x9d and the vicious early pre-Ready To Die demo \xe2\x80\x9cDead Wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d But the real story it tells is about Puff Daddy\xe2\x80\x94how he flailed into the spotlight after Big\xe2\x80\x99s death, how he treated his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. He immediately sought to cast himself as Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s equal: You can see the video for \xe2\x80\x9cVictory\xe2\x80\x9d as a sort of prelude. Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s verse play is just background music for shots of Puff Daddy running slow motion in front of explosions in the rain.' b'This is the kind of Biggie album Puff made without the stubborn, strong-willed Wallace present in the room to dig in his heels and say \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d The production for the album makes no sense\xe2\x80\x94it made no sense for a Biggie album in 1999, and it makes even less sense in 2017. The dank, chaotic original \xe2\x80\x9cNiggas\xe2\x80\x9d from 1993, produced by Mister Cee and gloriously scarred up with frenetic scratching, gets cleaned up and \xe2\x80\x9cupdated\xe2\x80\x9d all the way to 1999, sounding tame and inert. The Timb-boot funk of that basement session evaporates completely, and the song loses all of its meaning transferred into major-label sunlight.' b'Similarly, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to think about Mannie Fresh and Biggie in the same room with Biggie alive\xe2\x80\x94they were both inventive, antic minds that loved surprising word choices and unpredictable flows. But hearing Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s second ferocious verse stripped from the original version of \xe2\x80\x9cDead Wrong\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a song, remember, that appears elsewhere on this album\xe2\x80\x94laid over Fresh\xe2\x80\x99s bouncy instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cHope You Niggas Sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d and followed by verses from all the members of Hot Boys and Big Tymers, only underscores how dead Wallace was.' b'His verse from \xe2\x80\x9cDangerous MCs,\xe2\x80\x9d meanwhile, was meant to appear on a song from Busta Rhymes\xe2\x80\x99 The Coming, produced by J Dilla. It was scrapped purportedly because of some veiled threats at 2Pac lurking in it and the album\xe2\x80\x99s makers were leery of tossing any more powder into the keg. With them both dead, Big\xe2\x80\x99s incendiary lines detonate harmlessly over an airless, functional beat from Nottz: \xe2\x80\x9cCatch my drift/Or catch my four-fifth lift/At least six inches above project fences/Turn meat to minces/Jumps turn to flinches/When I rain I drenches/Cleared your park benches.\xe2\x80\x9d Hearing one dead man launch subliminals at another dead one is perverse, particularly since the producers arranged some East Coast/West Coast unity kabuki elsewhere on the project, bringing Ice Cube to rap a verse on \xe2\x80\x9cIf I Should Die Before I Wake\xe2\x80\x9d saluting Biggie as the \xe2\x80\x9cKing of New York.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""Is any of it worth it? Tough to say. Without this album, you might have never heard \xe2\x80\x9cRelax and take notes while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s a canonical line, and it introduces \xe2\x80\x9cDead Wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d the only near-classic here. The original, produced by Easy Moe Bee, is a giggly and profane game of Dozens, Biggie indulging his filthy imagination for all its worth: broomsticks get used for unspeakable purposes and Lucifer is laughed out of the room. On the new version, the stakes are higher, and the music sharper, a sideways-jerking, always-falling-off-the-beat thing that samples the Rev. Al Green, of all people. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t even fuck it up by including a new verse from a pissy white kid named Eminem on it, a rapper Big had never heard of who had mostly become famous at that point for making fun of his mom and boy bands. It all sounds a little tired in retrospect\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccannibals and exorcisms, animals havin' sex with 'em\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but at the time, it was a revelation."" b'The decision to bring Eminem in said a lot about Puffy\xe2\x80\x99s shifting priorities. Mark Pitts, an executive producer on Born Again, likened the project to \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding Frankenstein.\xe2\x80\x9d Even shortly after working on the project, he sounded queasy about it: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that bothered me was the [guests artists] on the album. He would\xe2\x80\x99ve respected them all, but he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have worked with them all. Just because they\xe2\x80\x99re hot doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they mesh.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Soon, he would accompany artists he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have even respected: Korn comes to mind. The trail of artists who can technically claim to have appeared alongside the Notorious B.I.G. has only grown more disheartening with time. \xe2\x80\x9cI did real songs with Big, no made-up shits,\xe2\x80\x9d Jadakiss sneered at 50 Cent in their 2006 battle. By then, having recorded a song next to Biggie Smalls was no longer rarefied air, and these were the first unreal songs with Big. In that sense, they inaugurated a long and sad tradition.' b'From Hendrix to Elvis to Nirvana, none of this death-industry stuff is new. But in hip-hop, a music tied so closely to the inhuman ravages of the drug war and the carceral state, the charge pulsed a little hotter. Nineties gangsta rap always smelled of sulfur, of various deals cut with sundry devils, and its most potent tracks gave those who confronted them a mortal thrill. Alive, Big could inhabit this archetype and artfully squirm out of it in the same line, and it only took his presence\xe2\x80\x94no more, no less\xe2\x80\x94to set this animation in motion. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, flows just grow through me/Like trees to branches, cliffs to avalanches,\xe2\x80\x9d he deadpanned on a throwaway line from Ready To Die\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe What.\xe2\x80\x9d You could lose an hour, or a year, thinking about the imagery there, plumbing the mind that casually bundled those two thoughts together. \xe2\x80\x9cWe dress up like ladies and burn \xe2\x80\x98em with dirty .380s,\xe2\x80\x9d he proposed on the Life After Death cut \xe2\x80\x9cNiggas Bleed.\xe2\x80\x9d These lines are well-worn by repetition that they should, by all rights, have lost their strangeness. And yet they have not: Imagine Big, all 300 pounds of him, packing heat, dressed in woman\xe2\x80\x99s clothes; once your mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye has seen that, you won\xe2\x80\x99t ever lose it. It\xe2\x80\x99s indelible.' b'On Born Again, he is immobilized, and can thus perform none of these tricks. You can feel the absence of his animating touch\xe2\x80\x94his hot breath, his shrewd eye, his capacious ear. This is when the mortification of his body was complete, and he was rendered as just a voice that others could manipulate without his consent. He has nothing to do with the music and no way of playing against his environment. As a result, there\xe2\x80\x99s no inner music at work, nothing much to listen harder for. A good artist leads you into their genre from some other, outside place, showing you the familiar shapes through the warping lens of their mind. Their individual predilections and quirks become\xc2\xa0elemental laws of physics, rules. Biggie\xe2\x80\x99s voice is all over Born Again, but you feel the absence of his mind. Here, he is just a gangsta rapper, the nimblest one that ever lived.'"
b'Grandaddy',6.0,b'Last Place',0,b'Experimental',b'March 8 2017',"b'A decade after their last album, Grandaddy pick up where they left off, for better and for worse.'","b'Some Grandaddy songs are about technology. Nearly all of them are about junk: Alcoholic robots and broken household appliances outlive\xc2\xa0their usefulness and are left to rust. But the same basic fate awaits lost kittens, lonely spacemen, forlorn miners, and hollowed-out cities of rural California, eulogized by a band whose fuzz\xc2\xa0pedals, analog synths, and withered harmonies\xc2\xa0always sound like they\xe2\x80\x99re about to give out. And much like Jed the Humanoid, Grandaddy themselves fizzled and popped, and then they just stopped with 2006\xe2\x80\x99s Just Like the Fambly Cat, essentially a Jason Lytle solo album. Given their dedication to documenting entropy, a \xe2\x80\x9ctriumphant comeback\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sort of thing one expects from this band. But as Last Place makes clear, the creeping sense that we\xe2\x80\x99ll all just end up in a pile of our emotional and physical baggage never goes out of style.' b'Lytle had kept busy since disassembling Grandaddy a decade ago: After moving to Montana to escape the relative bustle of the Central Valley, he released two solo\xc2\xa0LPs, produced Band of Horses, hooked up with Monsters of Blog Rock supergroup BNQT, and found a sensible benefactor in new label head Danger Mouse. But Grandaddy are still a state-of-the-art 2000 band, the sum of slack-motherfucker indie rock, the mid-fi experimentalism of Sparklehorse, and just enough of Mercury Rev and Flaming Lips\xe2\x80\x99 late-\xe2\x80\x9990s prog sweep. Most crucially, The Sophtware Slump countered the pre-millennial tension of trip-hop, Timbaland, and Radiohead with Y2k\xe2\x80\x99s definitive \xc2\xaf\\(\xe3\x83\x84)/\xc2\xaf album, speaking to people who came of age during the tech boom and felt like the 21st century could only promise shinier distractions from the same old pervasive suburban boredom.' b'If Last Place doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly sound happy about that fate coming to pass, at least Lytle\xe2\x80\x99s learning to deal. \xe2\x80\x9cWay We Won\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d begins the record with him\xc2\xa0accepting loss as some schmo living atop a box store, enjoying the \xe2\x80\x9ctropical smells and back-to-school sales,\xe2\x80\x9d the best most people can hope for in adulthood. This unusually zippy pop song is immediately followed by \xe2\x80\x9cBrush With the Wild,\xe2\x80\x9d also patterned after the closest thing Grandaddy had to a crossover hit (\xe2\x80\x9cNow It\xe2\x80\x99s On\xe2\x80\x9d), making for the most vigorous eight-minute stretch of music they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever committed to tape. At least musically, that is; lyrically, the trademark\xc2\xa0weariness remains. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a thing, whatever it\xe2\x80\x99s called,\xe2\x80\x9d Lytle moans, which is the most Grandaddy way possible to depict a busted romance. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Boat Is in the Barn\xe2\x80\x9d continues the theme: he\xe2\x80\x99s just another hoarder of junk, hanging onto their shared possessions and memories\xc2\xa0in hope of keeping the past alive, while the ex gingerly deletes pictures from her phone.' b'Last Place\xe2\x80\x99s first side sounds familiar, but it also promises a new kind of Grandaddy album: an uptempo collection of skewed pop songs without any kind of higher conceptual calling, music that is laid back but not insensate. While \xe2\x80\x9cChek Injin\xe2\x80\x9d is Grandaddy at their most punk rock, that surge in energy only goes so far, placing them somewhere in the orbit of Wilco\xe2\x80\x99s Star Wars. As Lytle yells, \xe2\x80\x9cplease keep going, please keep fucking going,\xe2\x80\x9d like he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to siphon one last drop of gas with his mouth, it becomes an unintentionally meta moment, as it\xe2\x80\x99s the last time Last Place strives for any kind of forward momentum.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cI Don\xe2\x80\x99t Wanna Live Here Anymore\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s What You Get For Gettin\xe2\x80\x99 Out of Bed\xe2\x80\x9d are pleasant, tuneful throwbacks to a pre\xe2\x80\x932k indie rock sarcasm, but they spend several minutes reiterating the point immediately made by their titles. The rest of Last Place just ties up loose ends: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s all a\xc2\xa0metaphor for being drunk and on the floor,\xe2\x80\x9d Lytle sings on \xe2\x80\x9cJed the 4th,\xe2\x80\x9d over-explaining prequels\xc2\xa0that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be interpreted any other way. \xe2\x80\x9cA Lost Machine\xe2\x80\x9d aspires to the same Floydian excess as \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s Simple, He\xe2\x80\x99s Dumb, He\xe2\x80\x99s the Pilot,\xe2\x80\x9d but unlike \xe2\x80\x9care you giving in, 2000 Man?,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceverything about us is a lost machine\xe2\x80\x9d generates less meaning with every repetition.' b'Taking the long view, Last Place might actually be a concept record about Grandaddy itself, as it recreates the trajectory of their previous four albums in miniature: quirks slowly congeal into banality, back roads are avoided in favor of familiar scenery. And then it ends like Grandaddy once did, with what essentially amounts to a Lytle solo project (\xe2\x80\x9cSongbird Son\xe2\x80\x9d). They sound exhausted, right where we left them.'"
b'Immolation',7.7,b'Atonement',0,b'Metal',b'March 8 2017',b'The new\xc2\xa0album from New York\xe2\x80\x99s Immolation is a\xc2\xa0masterclass in death metal songwriting. It pairs\xc2\xa0a queasy feeling of gloom with melodies\xc2\xa0you can actually hum along to.',"b'In the early \xe2\x80\x9990s, death metal luminaries like Death\xe2\x80\x99s Chuck Schuldiner and Morbid Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Trey Azagthoth introduced technicality to the raw, guttural template they\xe2\x80\x99d pioneered a few years earlier. At that point, death metal became a haven for artists who not only placed a high premium on chops but also thought of themselves as capital-C composers. (Gorguts bandleader Luc Lemay, for example, actually took private lessons in composition from a nun.) But over the genre\xe2\x80\x99s 30-year creep from the fringes to respectability, we still don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it as a songwriter\xe2\x80\x99s artform. That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily fair, as it takes enormous skill to wrest hooks from such harsh tones.' b'On Atonement, the 10th\xc2\xa0long-player from the New York-based second wave death metal outfit Immolation, guitarist Robert Vigna delivers a masterclass on songwriting in this framework. A cohesive listen from start to finish, Atonement contains twists, turns, peaks, and valleys galore\xe2\x80\x94a remarkable achievement considering that Immolation haven\xe2\x80\x99t modified their approach all that much since their 1991 debut Dawn of Possession. Atonement, in fact, begins with a short, detuned clean guitar phrase that reacquaints listeners with Vigna\xe2\x80\x99s preference for scales that sound as if they\xe2\x80\x99re warping under his fingertips.' b'As with\xc2\xa0so many of his peers, Vigna likes to play squealing leads that he double-tracks in discordant harmonies to create a\xc2\xa0queasy feeling of gloom. But he also possesses an unparalleled knack for injecting melody into his riffs without watering-down the heaviness or resorting to the inflated bombast of symphonic death metal. (Though former Goreaphobia/Incantation guitarist Alex Bouks joined Immolation last year, Vigna still plays all of the parts on the album, as he\xe2\x80\x99s done for much of the band\xe2\x80\x99s history.) Vigna crafted the album as a batch of songs you can actually hum along to. Looking back, how many of the genre\xe2\x80\x99s all-time classics can we say that about?' b'Even when compared to Immolation\xe2\x80\x99s back catalog, you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to find a more riveting string of transitions between songs. After a series of blast beats and double bassdrum rolls, second track \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Jackals Come\xe2\x80\x9d opens out onto an epic climax where Vigna guitars wail like a chorus of air raid sirens. Here, in a drawn-out ending that takes nearly as long as the song\xe2\x80\x99s main section, the music lends itself to the apocalyptic scenery the album cover depicts. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir war is already won,\xe2\x80\x9d sings vocalist/bassist Ross Dolan, \xe2\x80\x9cyour world will end when the jackals come\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a typical death metal lyric about societal collapse that takes on an unusually profound sense of tragedy thanks to the dolefulness in the music.' b'In a great sequencing move, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Jackals Come\xe2\x80\x9d simmers down onto the eerie drone that introduces \xe2\x80\x9cFostering the Divide,\xe2\x80\x9d which hints at Vigna and Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s affinity for the gothy ambient darkness of non-metal acts like Dead Can Dance. And though the drone component remains quite subtle throughout the album, mixer Zack Ohren\xc2\xa0leaves ample room for drummer Steve Shalaty\xe2\x80\x99s intricate cymbal patterns to come to the front and color even the most dense passages. Ohren\xe2\x80\x99s mix is beefy but not outsized or over-processed like so much modern metal can be. The music reveals endless contours over repeat listens.' b'Immolation have recorded with producer Paul Orofino since their third album, 1999\xe2\x80\x99s Failures for Gods. By this point, the band\xe2\x80\x99s work flow is well entrenched. Likewise, Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupation with religious and political institutions as agents of evil is still as fervent as it was from day one. At times, Dolan breathes a contemporary edge into his lyrics. \xe2\x80\x9cJackals\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0was inspired by John Perkins\xe2\x80\x99 book Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, while \xe2\x80\x9cFostering the Divide\xe2\x80\x9d aligns perfectly with the contentious tone of American politics (even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explicitly address the recent presidential election). Mostly, though, Dolan isn\xe2\x80\x99t saying anything he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said before. In a sense, neither is Vigna. But\xc2\xa0in death metal, consistency is the name of the game, and it\xe2\x80\x99s harder than it looks. If a band can \xe2\x80\x9csay\xe2\x80\x9d the same thing for 30\xc2\xa0years while\xc2\xa0delivering it with more flourish than they ever have, as Immolation have done with Atonement, then that\xc2\xa0really\xc2\xa0says something.'"
b'Elliott Smith',10.0,b'Either/Or: Expanded Edition',1,b'Rock',b'March 7 2017',"b""The 20th anniversary remaster of Smith's final solo album before his major label debut highlights its inimitable sound and style: a magical, alchemical mix of intimacy and bombast.""","b""About two minutes into Either/Or opener \xe2\x80\x9cSpeed Trials,\xe2\x80\x9d Elliott Smith\xe2\x80\x99s seamlessly double-tracked lead vocal splits into a two-part harmony.\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a very subtle gesture, and only lasts for a few seconds\xe2\x80\x94but contrasted with the tight, hushed unison of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s prior solo output, it feels as dramatic as The Wizard of Oz shifting from sepia to technicolor. This moment plays out like a microcosm of Either/Or at large, the sound of Smith conjuring something far bigger than himself and coming into his own as a songwriter, arranger, and performer. The final album in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s catalog before the major label-backed XO and Figure 8, *Either/Or *marks the last time Smith\xe2\x80\x99s instincts would outpace the studio resources to execute them. It's extraordinary how he embodies a magical, alchemical mix of intimacy and bombast."" b""By the time *Either/Or *was released in 1997, Smith was no stranger to the cynical machinations of the post-grunge major label gold rush. A year prior, his former band Heatmiser had been put through that very ringer, an experience captured in Either/Or standouts \xe2\x80\x9cPictures of Me\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAngeles.\xe2\x80\x9d Either/Or sounds like the work of somebody who has zero interest in either conforming to or directly transgressing the \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial\xe2\x80\x9d sounds of the day. It\xe2\x80\x99s too ambitious to read as \xe2\x80\x9clo-fi\xe2\x80\x9d and too gritty to read as straightforward pop classicism. Thankfully, this 20th anniversary remaster doesn't smooth out too many of those rough edges\xe2\x80\x94if anything, it brings the unique sound of the record into even clearer focus."" b'The sounds and words of Either/Or often conjure very specific images, textures, and situations. And yet, Smith\xe2\x80\x94as with many truly great songwriters\xe2\x80\x94used this specificity as a way to explore emotional themes that resonate both deeply and broadly. Nowhere is this clearer than \xe2\x80\x9cBetween the Bars,\xe2\x80\x9d the closest thing to a modern-day standard Smith ever wrote and covered by everyone from Metric to Madonna. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a love song, exactly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a song about addiction, exactly. \xe2\x80\x9cBetween the Bars\xe2\x80\x9d is about the ways in which protecting somebody you love turns into the need to control that person. The fact that Smith was able to build this much emotional complexity into a song that sounds at home in a stadium or at a Starbucks speaks to his irreplaceable gift as a songwriter.' b'Elsewhere, Smith amplifies his well-honed songwriting chops with more fleshed-out arrangements. \xe2\x80\x9cBallad of Big Nothing\xe2\x80\x9d propels itself forward with bubbly McCartney-esque bass lines and background vocals that sound like they might have been string arrangements if there were an orchestra handy. \xe2\x80\x9cAngeles\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCupid\xe2\x80\x99s Trick\xe2\x80\x9d provide a back-to-back study in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s versatility as a guitarist, going from intricate fingerpicked pattern to lopey electric riffs. By the time album closer \xe2\x80\x9cSay Yes\xe2\x80\x9d rolls around, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the solo acoustic approach is a specific and purposeful choice, and no longer Smith\xe2\x80\x99s default mode.' b'This reissue is framed as an \xe2\x80\x9cexpanded\xe2\x80\x9d edition, and the bonus materials included fit the bill nicely. Rather than aiming for comprehensiveness or definitiveness, the bonus tracks provide interesting glimpses into Smith\xe2\x80\x99s growing strength as a live solo performer (some excellent live recordings of album and non-album cuts), sense of humor (a sketch of New Moon\xc2\xa0track \xe2\x80\x9cNew Monkey\xe2\x80\x9d that sounds like it was played on a baseball organ), and where he would go with his next record (a formative version of XO cut \xe2\x80\x9cBottle Up and Explode!\xe2\x80\x9d that shows just how much thoughtful editing and revision went into the final version). And then there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Figured You Out,\xe2\x80\x9d a longtime fan favorite that Smith gave to his friend Mary Lou Lord to record because it \xe2\x80\x9csounds like the fuckin\xe2\x80\x99 Eagles.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI Figured You Out\xe2\x80\x9d would have been the most straightforward and polished song on Either/Or, and its omission speaks volumes about how determined Smith was to find his own voice and chart his own path.' b'In the years that followed the release of *Either/*Or, Smith managed to do just that, performing \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Misery\xe2\x80\x9d at the Academy Awards and releasing an uncompromising major label debut. For some of his fans, Either/Or marked the end of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s career as a direct and intimate folk singer-songwriter. For others, Either/Or marked the beginning of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s career as a one-man classic pop band. In truth,\xc2\xa0Either/Or marks the one moment in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s career when he was truly both.'"

Four years later, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of fight left in WHY?\xe2\x80\x94and yet, the project sounds completely rejuvenated for that very reason on Moh Lhean.' b'The remarkable thing about WHY? is that they neither needed a return to form nor a total reinvention. To the same degree *Mumps, etc. *turned\xc2\xa0Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s strengths\xe2\x80\x94excessive candor, a keen ear for melody\xe2\x80\x94into indefensible liabilities, *Moh Lhean *expands on the quiet inventiveness of *Alopecia\xe2\x80\x99s *less-heralded companion album\xc2\xa0Eskimo Snow. Previously, \xe2\x80\x9cpost-rock\xe2\x80\x9d just meant \xe2\x80\x9chip-hop\xe2\x80\x9d for WHY?, but they took on the late-\xe2\x80\x9990s Chicago sense of the term on Eskimo Snow, favoring neatly layered guitars, mallet percussion, mixed time signatures, and exquisite production values alongside Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s layering of obtuse metaphors and lurid self-disclosure.' b'If the genre-agnosticism of WHY? is no longer novel, it\xe2\x80\x99s still stunningly unique.\xc2\xa0The arrangements are dazzling in their coherence, especially given the diversity of instrumentation and textures whizzing throughout. The most striking aspect of *Moh Lhean *is how *beautiful *it is, even more so since this is their first self-produced album since 2003\xe2\x80\x99s *Oaklandazulasylum**, *one of the definitive documents of the Anticon\xe2\x80\x99s confrontational prog-hop. But\xc2\xa0*Moh Lhean *is built to withstand any live show where the triggers and synths malfunction. Acoustic guitar plays a surprising leading role\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0songs that could be covered as a sturdy blues (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Ole King\xe2\x80\x9d), steely folk (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Water\xe2\x80\x9d) and a straight-up power ballad (\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Washington\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'Unlike the pointedly organic *Eskimo Snow, Moh Lhean *contrasts all of its lush sounds with brash drum programming that mimics the\xc2\xa0ungainly motion of the human body, shifting in and out of rhythm with intricate math-rock layering or juddering non-quantized beats. Of course, these are the kind of playing fields where Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s unconventional vocals best operate. Though he\xe2\x80\x99s long proven capable of carrying a tune, Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s still no one\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a pretty vocalist. His imperfections\xe2\x80\x94the odd timbral grain of his high notes, his taste for self-deprecation (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be white, weak and blind/the opposite of oxen\xe2\x80\x9d)\xe2\x80\x94provide the edge even though *Moh Lhean *is anything but belligerent.' b'Wolf underwent a non-specific \xe2\x80\x9chealth scare\xe2\x80\x9d during the past few years and calls Moh Lhean a \xe2\x80\x9cbreakup album.\xe2\x80\x9d No longer psychosexual neuroses personified, Wolf exhibits a kind of post-traumatic calm, using situations as an opportunity to reflect on how to love and be present. *Moh Lhean *is rife with scenes that raise the possibility of WHY? having been\xc2\xa0a covert emo band all along\xe2\x80\x94watching shooting stars in the parking lot, writing love letters from the road, sitting in a boat with his brother after a hospital trip. Past albums relied on the shock value of confession for payoff, but Wolf trusts the emotional contours of his delivery to express the state of being in a moment across in concise, affecting phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cThis one thing,/There is no other,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on fire,\xe2\x80\x9d or, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got to submit to whatever it is in control.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Artistic restraint is a new concept for WHY? and it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable if *Moh Lhean *as a whole feels slightly tentative at points\xe2\x80\x94two of its ten tracks are interludes no more than a few seconds, the second of which serves as a preface to \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Washington\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote a song called \xe2\x80\x98The Longing Is All\xe2\x80\x99 instead of calling you/I\xe2\x80\x99d hoped that\xe2\x80\x99d solve me.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a line would\xe2\x80\x99ve sounded like an admission of defeat on *Mumps, etc., *which didn\xe2\x80\x99t lack for lyrics that ruminated on the futility of music. But on *Moh Lhean, *it\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of a promising new outlook. With his health and his band fully recovered, Wolf is starting to realize what matters with the clarity of someone who\xe2\x80\x99s seen a glimpse of the beyond.'"
b'Erasmo Carlos',9.0,b'Erasmo Carlos E Os Tremend\xc3\xb5es',0,b'Global',b'March 7 2017',"b'The Brazilian songwriter Erasmo Carlos remains beloved at home, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been widely heard outside Latin America. These\xc2\xa0three\xc2\xa0early \xe2\x80\x9970s LPs\xc2\xa0have been given new life thanks to Light in the Attic.'","b'Over the last half century, few countries have had as many international recording stars as Brazil. The famed names of its rich musical traditions have the same renown as its rock-star soccer players: Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Milton Nascimento, Tom Z\xc3\xa9, Elis Regina, Flora Purim, Jorge Ben, Carlinhos Brown, Seu Jorge, Marisa Monte to name just one possible dream-team XI. An artist\xc2\xa0who didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite resonate abroad\xe2\x80\x94who never glittered in the yellow national-team jersey, so to speak\xe2\x80\x94is Erasmo Carlos. At 75, Carlos remains beloved at home, but he\xc2\xa0hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been\xc2\xa0widely heard outside Latin America, which is a shame. As we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded by\xc2\xa0these\xc2\xa0reissues of his work from the early 1970s, his talents were enormous.' b'Three of his albums\xe2\x80\x94Erasmo Carlos E Os Tremend\xc3\xb5es (from 1970), Carlos, ERASMO...\xc2\xa0(1971), and Sonhos E Mem\xc3\xb3rias 1941\xe2\x80\x931972 (1972)\xe2\x80\x94have been given a new life thanks to Seattle label Light in the Attic. A smart essay by Allen Thayer, along with his detailed liner notes and translated lyrics, provides valuable context for the package.' b'Born in 1941, Erasmo Carlos first gained fame with Roberto Carlos as co-hosts of the musical television\xc2\xa0show \xe2\x80\x9cJovem Guarda\xe2\x80\x9d (young guard), which debuted in 1965 and was aimed at teenagers enamored with American rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll and the British Invasion.\xc2\xa0Erasmo, no relation to Roberto, was a heartthrob; he sported a new haircut on every magazine cover he graced. In 1968, though, \xe2\x80\x9cJovem Guarda\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0was canceled. Times were a changing and Erasmo was at sea. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one wanted to know me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a 2006 interview that Thayer cites.' b'But Carlos\xc2\xa0still had his guitar and his voice, a fantastic and versatile one. He left S\xc3\xa3o Paulo and returned to his\xc2\xa0hometown, Rio de Janeiro, where the new M\xc3\xbasica Popular Brasileira and Tropic\xc3\xa1lia\xe2\x80\x94a creative movement to counter the CIA-sponsored military junta that grabbed power in 1964\xe2\x80\x94were fomenting. Despite his teeny-bopper reputation, Carlos\xc2\xa0still had street cred among the new, edgier players on the scene, like Caetano Veloso. This was in part because of his Rio roots and in part because he had talent, much of it still undeveloped at that point.' b'That\xe2\x80\x99s where the story of these records begins. And what a new beginning it was. Though these albums were\xc2\xa0among the least commercial and least \xe2\x80\x9csuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d of Carlos\xe2\x80\x99 career, he is\xc2\xa0in full soul-baring mode during these years, as if he has nothing to lose. He mixes\xc2\xa0all the genres of the place and time (pop, rock, folk, samba, bossa nova, psychedelia, soul, funk) within a feijoada\xc2\xa0of horns, flutes, strings, distorted guitars, and vocal harmonies.' b'His 1970 effort Erasmo Carlos E Os Tremend\xc3\xb5es starts out soft with \xe2\x80\x9cEstou Dez Anos Atrasado\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Ten Years Too Late\xe2\x80\x9d), which has a\xc2\xa0goofy bombast not unlike the theme from the original \xe2\x80\x9cBatman\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0series. But the remaining\xc2\xa0tracks on the album are magnificent, filled with surprising twists and vocal leaps. \xe2\x80\x9cGloriosa\xe2\x80\x9d boasts\xc2\xa0a catchy melody and\xc2\xa0full string arrangement, organ, flutes, and fuzzy guitar, while the gentle ballad \xe2\x80\x9cEspuma Congelada\xe2\x80\x9d ends up in distorted Tropic\xc3\xa1lia territory by way of Sgt. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s. The effervescent \xe2\x80\x9cCoqueiro Verde\xe2\x80\x9d reflects Erasmo\xe2\x80\x99s umbilical attachment to samba. \xe2\x80\x9cTeletema,\xe2\x80\x9d a simple ditty written for a telenovela, is a quiet showcase for the wonderful textures of Erasmo\xe2\x80\x99s voice, a gift that carries all three of the recordings. He almost whispers though it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSoft/Celestial body/Goal, half/My sanctuary/My eternity/Illuminated/My way finally\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and reveals a vulnerability and depth.' b'The slow tempos of \xe2\x80\x9cMenina\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cVou Ficar N\xc3\xba Para Chamar Sua Aten\xc3\xa7ao\xe2\x80\x9d are perfect vehicles, too, for his keen sense of phrasing. Carlos\xc2\xa0does a gorgeous version of \xe2\x80\x9cSaudosismo,\xe2\x80\x9d penned by Veloso\xe2\x80\x94who, by 1970, was in exile in London after a short prison stay in Brazil. (The song could be read as\xc2\xa0a middle finger to government authorities, who, as Thayer writes\xc2\xa0in the notes, would surely have been made aware of its existence.) It\xe2\x80\x99s juxtaposed, oddly, with the familiar and patriotic \xe2\x80\x9cAquarela do Brasil,\xe2\x80\x9d which could work as well in a documentary on the pro footballer Pel\xc3\xa9 or a Varig airline commercial. Still, Erasmo\xe2\x80\x99s rendition is irresistible.' b'Carlos, ERASMO..., out the following year, saw a slight shift from Erasmo\xe2\x80\x99s 1970 effort. It was co-produced by\xc2\xa0Manoel Barenbein, who had helmed the landmark\xc2\xa0Tropic\xc3\xa1lia album just a few years prior, and featured\xc2\xa0several\xc2\xa0of its backing musicians.\xc2\xa0Carlos, ERASMO...\xc2\xa0also included\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDe Noite Na Cama,\xe2\x80\x9d written specifically for Erasmo by Veloso\xc2\xa0while still in exile. \xe2\x80\x9cMasculino, Feminino\xe2\x80\x9d is a beauty, a slow duet with the angelic-voiced Marisa Fossa that has the feel of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden\xe2\x80\x94if there were red wine and Marlboro Lights. In \xe2\x80\x9cE\xcc\x81 Preciso Dar Um Jeito, Meu Amigo\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cGotta Find a Way, My Friend\xe2\x80\x9d), written with his old partner Roberto Carlos, Erasmo has drive and urgency in his voice: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed/With the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen/But I will not be silent/Accommodated in comfort/As so many out there.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cAgora Ningu\xc3\xa9m Chora Mais\xe2\x80\x9d is a Jorge Ben original that\xe2\x80\x99s reinvented as a driving, plugged-in, harmonized group chant: \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole world cried/But now no one cries anymore/Cry more, cry more.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Sonhos E Mem\xc3\xb3rias 1941\xe2\x80\x931972 is the most focused and measured of the three albums and serves as a kind of personal diary (Carlos was born in \xe2\x80\x9941). There are photos of Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, and Andy Warhol on the cover, and (perhaps more importantly) a team shot of Rio\xe2\x80\x99s Vasco da Gama soccer club. In \xe2\x80\x9cBom Dia, Rock\xe2\x80\x99N\xe2\x80\x99Roll,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlos\xc2\xa0references Elvis, the Beatles, Chuck Berry, and Carole King and James Taylor. The music\xc2\xa0is anchored by a rhythm section that would become the jazz fusion trio Azymuth, who gained momentum later in the \xe2\x80\x9970s and into the smoother jazz \xe2\x80\x9980s. With exceptions like \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x89 Proibido Fumar\xe2\x80\x9d and the second half of \xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xa1bado Morto,\xe2\x80\x9d which takes an unexpected vocal turn, Sonhos E Mem\xc3\xb3rias 1941\xe2\x80\x931972 feels less chance-y than the previous two albums.' b'After all, it was risk that got Carlos\xc2\xa0to this point. On his\xc2\xa01970 album, when he was at his lowest, he recorded what became a hit song*,* one that brought him renewed notice and enabled future work and creative freedom. \xe2\x80\x9cSentado \xc3\xa0 Beira do Caminho\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cSitting on the Side of the Road\xe2\x80\x9d), perhaps a\xc2\xa0wink to an American classic, is majestic. Erasmo, backed by little more than an organ and an acoustic guitar, sings as if he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking directly to us, and, in the process, reassuring himself: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t stay here anymore and wait/That one day suddenly you will come back to me... I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting on the side of a road that has no/end.\xe2\x80\x9d And then this, a fulfilled wish: \xe2\x80\x9cI need to get this over with/I must remember that I exist/I exist, I exist.\xe2\x80\x9d'"
b'Ibibio Sound Machine',7.0,b'Uyai',0,b'Global',b'March 7 2017',"b'Led by singer Eno Williams, Uyai\xc2\xa0becomes a wildly diverse mix of global sounds whose focus this time has turned\xc2\xa0to themes of liberation, power, and beauty\xe2\x80\x94specifically that of women.'","b'If you crossed \xe2\x80\x9970s Nigerian highlife with LCD Soundsystem, you might get something like the opening track of Uyai. On \xe2\x80\x9cGive Me a Reason,\xe2\x80\x9d highlife trumpets and talking drums punch through buzzy synth lines and metallic drum machine effects. Like most dance music, it seeks liberation. Unlike most, it also laments: \xe2\x80\x9cAs the story goes, they got sent to a house of wisdom/To learn all that the world can offer/But on setting out, they got lost,\xe2\x80\x9d Eno Williams sings in Ibibio, a language of southeast Nigeria. The song speaks about the 276 Chibok girls who were abducted three years ago, the vast majority of whom are still missing.' b'Led by London-born, Lagos-raised singer Williams, Ibibio Sound Machine are an eight-piece band whose music draws on Nigerian highlife as much as new wave, South African jazz as much as techno, Cameroonian makossa as much as disco. Besides being a nod to the Ibibio language and region that Williams\xe2\x80\x99 family comes from, the band\xe2\x80\x99s name is also a wink at Miami Sound Machine, whose \xe2\x80\x9980s pop exuberance and cultural mash-up are approaches that Ibibio shares. The band\xe2\x80\x99s new release, Uyai,\xc2\xa0meaning \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty,\xe2\x80\x9d is their first since their self-titled debut in 2014. Accompanying a switch from the more vintage-oriented Soundway Records to indie rock label Merge, their sound has expanded to include more electronic and rock influences but has also grown more introspective. They still incorporate the kind of Ibibio storytelling\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0was at the center of\xc2\xa0Ibibio Sound Machine, but their focus this time has turned\xc2\xa0to themes of liberation, power, and beauty\xe2\x80\x94specifically that of women.' b'Throughout the album, Eno draws on the presence of the women in her life, highlighting the experiences and histories that link them. Her sister and friends join her on several tracks as backing vocalists. On \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chant (Iquo Isang),\xe2\x80\x9d her mom even makes a cameo chanting an improvised prayer, whispering and growling over shakers and a four-on-the-floor thump. Williams too recounts a chant from her schoolgirl days\xe2\x80\x94the chorus from \xe2\x80\x9cZangalewa\xe2\x80\x9d (originally by Cameroonian makossa group Golden Sounds; a couple decades later lifted by Shakira for the 2010 World Cup anthem). In writing \xe2\x80\x9cJoy (Idaresit),\xe2\x80\x9d an experimental techno-rock track, Williams was inspired by an older woman she saw dancing who reminded her of her own mother. By contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cLullaby\xe2\x80\x9d shows\xc2\xa0the singer as the mother figure. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the gentler tracks, colored by atmospheric reverb, tinkly EKG blips, and bubbling talking drum.' b'As grounded as Williams is in her own roots, her and Ibibio\xe2\x80\x99s vision also taps into music across the\xc2\xa0African Diaspora.\xc2\xa0On \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pot Is on Fire\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGuide You (Edu Kpeme),\xe2\x80\x9d Ghanaian keyboardist Emmanuel Rentzos, of Osibisa fame, contributes playful synth-work. On tracks peppered with swiveling robot sounds and cowbells, percussionist Anselmo Netto plays Afro-Brazilian percussion, like the squeaky cu\xc3\xadca (as on \xe2\x80\x9cGuide You\xe2\x80\x9d) or\xc2\xa0the conga-like atabaque and boomy surdo (as on \xe2\x80\x9cPower of 3\xe2\x80\x9d). Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cOne That Lights Up (Andi Domo Ikang Uwem Mi)\xe2\x80\x9d is a love song that sounds like watercolors, where the horns reference\xc2\xa0South African jazz, and distorted mbiras recall Kinshasa\xe2\x80\x99s Konono\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xba1.' b""With all these musical influences and elements at play, Uyai could easily be a\xc2\xa0chaotic mess. For the most part, it's not, but every element doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always feel necessary. On \xe2\x80\x9cPower of 3,\xe2\x80\x9d there\xe2\x80\x99s a solid 30-second passage of laser gun sounds. The album as a whole has a lot of laser gun sounds. It also has frequent sudden shifts between high energy songs and mellower songs, so that even though the record\xc2\xa0has a unified\xc2\xa0sound, it sometimes feels\xc2\xa0disjointed. During the last two songs, however, that contrast\xc2\xa0works.\xc2\xa0On the tenderest moment of the album, \xe2\x80\x9cCry (Eyed),\xe2\x80\x9d Eno intones the word \xe2\x80\x9ccry\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0over and over again\xc2\xa0over a muted balafon-esque pattern, as if by way of slow repetition we could find some release.\xc2\xa0On album closer \xe2\x80\x9cTrance Dance\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in a whirl of syncopated rhythms, chiptune blips, and guitar fuzz\xe2\x80\x94we finally do."""
b'The Magnetic Fields',7.4,b'50 Song Memoir',0,b'Rock',b'March 6 2017',"b'On this 5-disc musical memoir, Stephin Merritt has penned\xc2\xa0a song for each of the\xc2\xa0first 50 years of his life. His writing\xc2\xa0suggests that our deepest wisdom can be located in our most personal thoughts.'","b'Following his late-1990s triumph 69 Love Songs,\xc2\xa0Stephin Merritt\xc2\xa0began\xc2\xa0cannily organizing\xc2\xa0his Magnetic Fields songs. There was 2004\xe2\x80\x99s alphabetic\xc2\xa0i, followed by the genre filters of\xc2\xa02008\xe2\x80\x99s *Distortion\xc2\xa0*and\xc2\xa02009\xe2\x80\x99s Realism. In 2012, Merritt took on a slightly defeatist project\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe concept is there is no concept!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with Love at the Bottom of the Sea, an album whose lack of thematic unity resulted in a disappointingly uneven listen. Now, the Magnetic Fields return with a\xc2\xa0record\xc2\xa0that, like 69 Love Songs, forces Merritt to get focused and inspired.\xc2\xa050 Song Memoir is easily the best gimmick Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s stumbled upon since the turn of the century.' b'Arranged chronologically with a song for each of the first 50 years of Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s life, *50 Song Memoir *is a conceptually satisfying work, spanning five discs and two-and-a-half hours without feeling repetitive or samey. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing Merritt has learned over his three decades as a songwriter\xe2\x80\x94besides how to seamlessly insert limericks into songs\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s how to pace himself on record, keeping his quasi-showtunes from becoming cloying, his jokier ones\xc2\xa0from turning precious, and his ballads from sounding melodramatic.' b'Of course, for anyone turned off by the idea of Merritt\xe2\x80\x94an escapist pop descendent of Bacharach and Sondheim\xe2\x80\x94getting all Benji on us, you will be relieved to know that the story of his life sounds a lot like a Magnetic Fields album, and a very good one at that. There are some deeply revealing moments here. The opening songs, in particular, pinpoint\xc2\xa0the origins of Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s career-spanning themes of placelessness and unrequited love\xe2\x80\x94how they began with\xc2\xa0his parents\xe2\x80\x99 wanderlust and a childhood cat, respectively.\xc2\xa0But\xc2\xa050 Song Memoir\xc2\xa0often takes a less literal route through Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s life. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9976 Hustle 76\xe2\x80\x9d illustrates its time period by mimicking the then-inescapable sound of disco. Judy Garland\xe2\x80\x99s death gets its own song, as does the rise of synthesizer music in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s. For a songwriter who once formulated an entire record around the first-person pronoun, *50 Song Memoir *is more selfless than its title indicates. Here, Merritt seems more interested in exploring the moments that mark time\xe2\x80\x94where we\xe2\x80\x99ve lived, who we\xe2\x80\x99ve loved and lost\xe2\x80\x94than tracing his own particular narrative.' b'As a result, *50 Song Memoir *is an immersive, incisive listen, despite its avoidance of traditionally memoiristic details (we never, for example, learn the names of Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s parents, whether he has siblings, what it was like trying to follow-up a breakthrough album, etc). The themes that Merritt addresses over multiple songs become the album\xe2\x80\x99s guiding lights. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the young dudes of 25/Caught diseases, few survived,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9990 Dreaming in Tetris,\xe2\x80\x9d before explaining, \xe2\x80\x9cWe expected nuclear war/What should we take precautions for?\xe2\x80\x9d The AIDS crisis influences many of these songs, adding an ominous shadow to the darker tracks and a mournful tone to the love songs.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s something jarring about Merritt singing so directly about his fears\xe2\x80\x94even his bleakest work used to come bundled with the naivety of a hopeless romantic. It helps that most of the album sits squarely in Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s musical comfort zones. Like\xc2\xa0Love at the Bottom of the Sea, *50 Song Memoir *draws inspiration from the sounds of each of his records, from the psychedelic synth pop of *Holiday *to the indie-film-trailer twee of i, even making room for genre exercises in dance music\xc2\xa0(his Future Bible Heroes\xc2\xa0records) and surf-rock (Distortion).' b'By the album\xe2\x80\x99s end, though, the songs begin to lack the cultural context that distinguished the earlier ones, and\xc2\xa050 Song Memoir\xc2\xa0borders on morphing into just\xc2\xa0Several More Love Songs. But among these sit some of his finest tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cI guess\xc2\xa0there\xe2\x80\x99d be other fish in the sea/But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want fishes and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want me,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in the exquisite \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9905 Never Again.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s the exact kind of song that would turn to putty in the hands of a lesser writer, but Merritt knows how to wring it for emotional resonance. In fact, its place near the end of the album almost signals\xe2\x80\x94more than the impact of the breakup\xe2\x80\x94his growing mastery as a songwriter. It suggests that our deepest wisdom can be located in our most personal thoughts. \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had something better to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, \xe2\x80\x9cBut even my own clothes remind me of you.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Just one song later, Merritt gets a little too specific, showing\xc2\xa0what the album might have been if he took its title more seriously. In \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9906 \xe2\x80\x98Quotes,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Merritt dredges up an old controversy that involved several music critics accusing him of racism. The subject matter has him sounding slightly bitter and self-righteous, but even worse, it simply\xc2\xa0doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make for a good Magnetic Fields song. Merritt\xe2\x80\x99s work has always been less confessional and more \xe2\x80\x9cThings Fitting Perfectly Into Other Things\xe2\x80\x9d: you listen to his songs and marvel at how effortlessly he packs his thoughts into verse, one rhyme parlaying into the next. The best of *50 Song Memoir *plays to his gifts (\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the time I began, I was mostly vegan,\xe2\x80\x9d he boasts in an early song), but with an extra layer of urgency, tied to the task of representing an entire year in a tightly structured pop song. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the least autobiographical person you are likely to meet,\xe2\x80\x9d Merritt admitted with typically humdrum candor in an interview about the album, \xe2\x80\x9cI will probably not write any more true songs after this than I did before.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s likely already dreaming up his next project\xe2\x80\x94putting the past behind him and moving on, his catalog 50 songs richer as a result.'"

Problem is that he took all the noise with him. Though his work with the Antlers never had anyone confusing him with J Mascis, years of touring left Silberman with a\xc2\xa0debilitating hearing ailment that started as piercing tinnitus and evolved into a constant sound of \xe2\x80\x9cNiagara Falls in my head.\xe2\x80\x9d Even if aural healing was Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s priority during his convalescence, there was no doubt what he was really working towards. His proper solo debut *Impermanence *is the result of physical, mental and emotional therapy, a man trying to re-enter his own life.' b'This is a guy who likened romantic failure to cancer and a dead dog, so the possibility of him turning this into a gut-wrenching metaphorical ordeal was very real. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost more understandable that Silberman wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need to dramatize his situation, given the timing of it all. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disassembling piece by piece,\xe2\x80\x9d he moans on the record\xe2\x80\x99s first line, though that describes less his own rehabilitation than affirms\xc2\xa0Antlers\xe2\x80\x99 M.O. since their 2009 breakthrough. Hospice*\xc2\xa0now stands as the last true exemplar of \xe2\x80\x9c2000s indie,\xe2\x80\x9d touching on Radiohead\xe2\x80\x99s quasi-prog song structures,\xc2\xa0Sigur R\xc3\xb3s\xe2\x80\x99 amniotic ambiance, and\xc2\xa0Arcade Fire\xe2\x80\x99s skyscraping crescendos. But since then, they\xe2\x80\x99ve veered more toward the variously fanged and stoned Burst Apart, which\xc2\xa0turned out to be a tentative step towards the zonked-out laser-Floyd ambiance that defined their most recent work on Undersea\xc2\xa0*and *Familiars**. *And the process of Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s reassembly has resulted in something not too far from what Antlers themselves might have put together in 2017.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cNew York\xe2\x80\x9d is the most immediately fetching song on *Impermanence, something like Interpol\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cNYC\xe2\x80\x9d if it was performed like the Grace\xc2\xa0*version of \xe2\x80\x9cHallelujah.\xe2\x80\x9d Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s falsetto hovers over a\xc2\xa0translucent guitar, homesick for a place where he already lives: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen my nerve wore down/I was assailed by simple little sounds/hammer clangs, sirens in the park/like I never heard New York.\xe2\x80\x9d While he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite have the natural vocal hops of his immediate influences, Silberman is one of the last true believers of the Buckley/Yorke school of operatic angst and he\xe2\x80\x99s become just as effective as a lead instrument. For a lot of listeners, it\xe2\x80\x99s a short step from Radiohead to Talk Talk and *Impermanence *unsurprisingly evokes *Laughing Stock**, *the gold standard for mid-career, post-rock spiritual cleansing: \xe2\x80\x9cKaruna\xe2\x80\x9d begins with a few seconds of low amp buzz and a loosely knotted guitar chord that *has to be *an overt homage to \xe2\x80\x9cMyrrhman.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""It\xe2\x80\x99s a spare album that asks for a lot of patience, if only a fraction of what Silberman needed to rehabilitate his ears in isolation. Impermanence isn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to sound lonely, however; there are nearly a dozen contributors if you include Big Sur and Block Island, RI for their provision of field sounds. The most important is engineer and mixer Nicholas Principe, a frequent collaborator whose Port St. Willow project often felt spiritually akin to Silberman's work. Principe is part of a quartet that providing doo-wop vocals during \xe2\x80\x9cGone Beyond,\xe2\x80\x9d a supremely stoned jazz riff that ends with a presumptive cue for a vinyl flip. Yet the bulk of *Impermanence *suggests that burning these songs to a tangible item is a necessarily evil: the credits include Tibetan bowls and *ujjayi breath, *and the song titles (\xe2\x80\x9cKaruna,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAhimsa\xe2\x80\x9d) themselves are taken from basic principles of eastern philosophy in accordance with Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s continuing desire to atone for the mean-spirited Burst Apart."" b'Though *Impermanence *is unmistakably a record about Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s physical ailments, the lyrics attempt to find a balance between being *just *about that (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m listening for you, silence\xe2\x80\x9d) and giving the listener something they can apply to their own lives (\xe2\x80\x9cOur bodies are temporary\xe2\x80\x9d). Likewise, the six songs take a long time to assess whether they\xe2\x80\x99re meant to offer serenity or a path to transcendence and whether Silberman\xe2\x80\x99s self-imposed musical limitations can support his most philosophically ambitious work yet. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a slight to call *Impermanence *functional music: If it helps someone else simply cut through the noise in their head, Silberman has gotten his point across.'"

Someday your alias won\xe2\x80\x99t sound ridiculous. Keep going.\xe2\x80\x9d A comforting gesture, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Daedelus had DJ Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s name in mind. Since last year, the young Swedish house producer\xe2\x80\x94who also goes by Rimbaudian, referencing the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud\xe2\x80\x94has been caught in the crossfire of an ongoing debate on the topic of authenticity in house music.' b'Along with such producers as DJ Boring and Ross From Friends,\xc2\xa0DJ Seinfeld has helped usher\xc2\xa0in a new era of house music that prioritizes pleasure over precision; feeling over substance. With that\xe2\x80\x94love it or hate it\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9clo-fi\xe2\x80\x9d dominated the scene in 2016. Satisfaction is their M.O., and the internet is their oyster.

DJ Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s own track \xe2\x80\x9cU\xe2\x80\x9d has accrued over 300,000 plays on the same platform since October.' b'The music DJ Seinfeld makes isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that divisive on its own. His debut *Season 1 *EP, released last year, presented a freewheeling collection of five jacking beats dipping between vaporwave funk, scorched-earth acid, and tribal house. It\xe2\x80\x99s emotive party music with a youthful, no-fucks-given approach. Aside from the cover art\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of Jerry and George in a decidedly Macintosh Plus aesthetic and a track entitled \xe2\x80\x9cJerry,\xe2\x80\x9d DJ Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s namesake is nowhere to be found in the tunes themselves.' b'The \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld\xe2\x80\x9d graphics have vanished for\xc2\xa0the three-track\xc2\xa0*Sunrise *EP,\xc2\xa0replaced with appropriative imagery of another kind\xe2\x80\x94a cheeky smiley face recalling the ubiquitous symbol of acid house and a dog happily sniffing its own ass, like an ouroboros (the ancient\xc2\xa0symbol\xc2\xa0of a serpent\xc2\xa0eating its tail). The acid house reference is undeniable, and on \xe2\x80\x9cChat Shit Get Luved,\xe2\x80\x9d DJ Seinfeld draws up a gnarly 303 bassline from subterranean depths as the claps reverberate through a cavernous space. It\xe2\x80\x99s an effective club track, but it reaches top velocity fairly quickly, and stays there for five minutes of clenched-fist tension. It forgoes the archetypal EDM \xe2\x80\x9cbuild\xe2\x80\x9d and offers little variation other than a few predictably satisfying bass drops.' b'DJ Seinfeld evokes the cyclical nature\xc2\xa0of the ouroboros on\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBeginning of an End,\xe2\x80\x9d where he transports us to a shimmering synthscape with a 4/4 pulse less ferocious than the rest of the EP. Meanwhile, a voice recites the 1932 poem\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDo Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\xe2\x80\x9d by Mary Elizabeth Frye. As Frye\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0voice is swallowed up by DJ Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0gently lapping waves, her\xc2\xa0words\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cDo not stand at my grave and cry/I am not there; I did not die\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94emphasize morbid introspection.' b'The highlight here is \xe2\x80\x9cFlyin\xe2\x80\x99 Thru Sunrise,\xe2\x80\x9d a stomping slice of nouveau-deep-house. Again, DJ Seinfeld doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide anything, as he recasts\xc2\xa0a snippet from the matriarch of the deep house vocal, Sade Adu. The sample comes\xc2\xa0from her 1992\xc2\xa0Love Deluxe slow-burner \xe2\x80\x9cPearls.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Her words aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cFlyin\xe2\x80\x99 thru sunrise,\xe2\x80\x9d as the title suggests, but rather \xe2\x80\x9cdying to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s effective inasmuch as it plays up the moody ecstasy of Moodymann or Larry Heard, but \xe2\x80\x9cFlyin\xe2\x80\x99 Thru Sunrise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s blatant emotion is also its greatest weakness. Sade\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPearls\xe2\x80\x9d is an elegy to a woman in Somalia barely scraping by; it\xe2\x80\x99s a heartbreaking track about struggle and survival, literally \xe2\x80\x9cdying to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d For DJ Seinfeld, it\xe2\x80\x99s fodder for a bleary-eyed banger.' b""Reinterpretation and re-contextualization are cornerstones of house music, and DJ Seinfeld hasn't really done anything wrong here. But the blatant acts of appropriation in his choice of name, visual aesthetic, and samples make one wonder what exactly Seinfeld is getting at. While electronic music can offer the allure of anonymity or an alter-ego, DJ Seinfeld lacquers an opaque, kitschy dose of irreverence on top every surface\xc2\xa0of his project. He\xe2\x80\x99s not hiding from view\xe2\x80\x94he wants your attention."""
b'Sleaford Mods',7.9,b'ENGLiSH TAPAS',0,b'Rock',b'March 6 2017',"b'On their first full-length for Rough Trade, the clattering duo Sleaford Mods\xc2\xa0remain bards of a Great Britain that is not in fact great, but sloppy, self-important, and wholly lacking in taste.'","b'English cuisine is hardly the horror show that it was in the 1970s\xe2\x80\x94the British Isles are no longer a Michelin Star free zone\xe2\x80\x94but the title of Sleaford Mods\xe2\x80\x99 new album still raises a smile of recognition. For ENGLiSH TAPAS,\xc2\xa0they\xe2\x80\x99ve upsized from Nottingham imprint Harbinger Sound to one of the most storied independent labels\xc2\xa0in history, Rough Trade. But vocalist Jason Williamson and producer Andrew Fearn still keep their gaze fixed in the direction of the discount aisle, bards of a Great Britain that is not in fact great, but sloppy, shallow, self-important, and wholly lacking in taste.' b'When Sleaford Mods broke out around 2013, Britain was in the grip of austerity, an economic philosophy applied by the Conservative-led government that seemed to inform both the duo\xe2\x80\x99s downtrodden lyrical content and the pared-back clatter of their music. Those days, though, feel insipid compared to 2017\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical realities, this slow mudslide into state-sanctioned\xc2\xa0cruelty and small-minded authoritarianism. ENGLiSH TAPAS contains\xc2\xa0a few fleeting references to the state we are in, like nods to Brexit in \xe2\x80\x9cCuddly\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDull.\xe2\x80\x9d A\xc2\xa0breathless rockabilly lurch, titled \xe2\x80\x9cCarlton Touts,\xe2\x80\x9d finds Williamson mock-mourning the dislodged elites that his lyrics once vilified: \xe2\x80\x9cBring back the neolibs, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry/I didn\xe2\x80\x99t fucking mean to pray for anarch-eh!\xe2\x80\x9d But it would be an overstatement\xc2\xa0to call this Sleaford Mods\xe2\x80\x99 Brexit LP. Instead,\xc2\xa0ENGLiSH TAPAS\xc2\xa0mostly finds Williamson further honing the contours of his singular East Midlands vernacular, with special attention paid to the lifestyles of the tragic and washed-up modern male unable to meet even the low expectations that have been set for him.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cArmy Nights\xe2\x80\x9d sets the tone, a bumptious opener sending up the special brand of idiocy that occurs in mess halls, stag dos, locker rooms\xe2\x80\x94any place that men congregate without women. Elsewhere, Williamson returns over and over to the topic of alcohol and substance abuse\xe2\x80\x94specifically, to the impulse to get out of one\xe2\x80\x99s mind as a way of ignoring the misery of existence. \xe2\x80\x9cMessy Anywhere\xe2\x80\x9d is a lads-on-the-town chant that ironically undercuts itself at every stride. \xe2\x80\x9cDrayton Manored\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rhymed with \xe2\x80\x9cspannered,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning \xe2\x80\x9cextremely drunk\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a lurid tale of home drinking, punctuated by the occasional taxi journey\xc2\xa0to restock, which Fearn mischievously illustrates with a supermarket checkout bleep. Williamson doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold back in his writing\xe2\x80\x94quite the opposite. But he is never merciless, and his character sketches are shot through with a been-there wisdom, a sense of there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I.' b'Williams is often typecast as a ranter, but\xc2\xa0ENGLiSH TAPAS\xc2\xa0is at least as funny as it is angry. Words erupt\xc2\xa0out of him with stray lines that stick: \xe2\x80\x9cYa so dead in the head you got a job-facing life\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cMessy Anywhere\xe2\x80\x9d); \xe2\x80\x9cCar crash into the void of the Magna Carta\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cSnout\xe2\x80\x9d); \xe2\x80\x9cI had an organic chicken it was shit\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cCuddly\xe2\x80\x9d). \xe2\x80\x9cCarlton Touts\xe2\x80\x9d boasts a chorus that somehow crams four good jokes into as many lines. But for all the humor, there is a palpable sense of desperation, a yawning emptiness that lies just beneath the surface. \xe2\x80\x9cTime Sands\xe2\x80\x9d muses on the drudgery of existence, the \xe2\x80\x9cquiet hell/Of cigarettes and trains and plastic and bad brains,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cDull\xe2\x80\x9d is utterly chilling, its dubby murk evoking cold English suffering as bleak as anything on PiL\xe2\x80\x99s Metal Box.' b'Has success changed these perennial underdogs? A little, perhaps. \xe2\x80\x9cJust Like We Do\xe2\x80\x9d is one of the weaker tracks here, a swipe at experimental music snobs who hate the Mods just \xe2\x80\x98cos they\xe2\x80\x99re famous (although Williamson does have the grace to acknowledge that he \xe2\x80\x9cused to be one of \xe2\x80\x98em\xe2\x80\x9d). But there remains\xc2\xa0an essential morality that runs throughout Sleaford Mods\xe2\x80\x99 music, a reflexive siding with the oppressed. The album\xe2\x80\x99s lead single \xe2\x80\x9cB.H.S.\xe2\x80\x9d addresses the disgraced tycoon Philip Green, who asset-stripped the department store he owned and fled to the Med leaving his staff without pensions. Williamson and Fearn conduct it as a jerky chicken dance, the sort of thing Pan\xe2\x80\x99s People might have jigged around to on an old \xe2\x80\x9cTop of the Pops.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Sleaford Mods remain literally unique. By turns,\xc2\xa0ENGLiSH TAPAS\xc2\xa0reminds you of acts as remote as\xc2\xa0Happy Mondays, Pet Shop Boys, and Crass, while never sounding anything like any of them. The closing \xe2\x80\x9cI Feel So Wrong\xe2\x80\x9d finds Williamson switching things up, his scattershot rant softening into a lightly weathered croon. It harkens back to some of the stylistic departures on 2015\xe2\x80\x99s *Key Markets**\xe2\x80\x94*probably Sleaford Mods\xe2\x80\x99 high watermark to date, a record that opened up a few avenues that remain unexplored here. Still, if\xc2\xa0ENGLiSH TAPAS\xc2\xa0at times veers towards formula, it\xe2\x80\x99s at least Sleaford Mods\xe2\x80\x99 own formula, and one that continues to serve them well.'"
b'DMX',9.0,b'It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot',0,b'Rap',b'March 5 2017',b'The debut album from DMX is the Dante\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0Inferno\xc2\xa0of rap. His infamous stage presence and aggression gave a voice to the voiceless in the streets of New York and overnight changed the course of hip-hop.',"b'Earl Simmons suffered a lonely and abusive childhood where as a troubled kid he would sometimes wander the streets and befriend stray dogs. Uprooted from his native Baltimore at a young age, the Yonkers transplant did several stints in New York\xe2\x80\x99s Children\xe2\x80\x99s Village group home, where he first started fiddling with drum machines and beatboxing as a means of escape. He segued from DJing to rapping as a young adult, taking the name DMX from the drum machine he used. The young rapper made a name for himself on New York\xe2\x80\x99s battle circuit with a commanding voice and overwhelming tenacity. Aggressiveness would become his calling card as an MC, a defense mechanism held over from when the days when armed robbery helped him survive on the streets. His battles to live and cope both in and outside of rap would lead to 1998\xe2\x80\x99s It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot, his haunting debut, a tragically clear-eyed criminal manifesto that dared to greet damnation with defiance and a psalm.' b'Rocking a skull-embroidered hat, DMX the Great appeared in The Source\xe2\x80\x99s Unsigned Hype column in January 1991, garnering comparisons to LL Cool J, PMD, and Hit Squad\xe2\x80\x99s K-Solo (whom DMX had met in prison). The earliest DMX demos were tedious, without the defining presence he\xe2\x80\x99d grow into. But it was in the ring that he truly built his rep, making an indelible mark on the underground scene with heavily rhythmic flows and a battler\xe2\x80\x99s bluntness. When he traded bars with Jay Z in a cramped Bronx pool hall in the late \xe2\x80\x9990s, head bobbing violently, cigarette in hand, he proved himself to be a raw, almost boorish alternative to Hov\xe2\x80\x99s shifty slick talk. The energy in the room clearly favored X\xe2\x80\x99s style. Jay would later ask industry maneuverer mutual friend Irv Gotti, \xe2\x80\x9cYou think he\xe2\x80\x99s better than me?\xe2\x80\x9d to which Gotti replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look in the hood, there\xe2\x80\x99s less niggas like you and more niggas like him.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The Unsigned Hype column was known for producing deals. True to form, DMX signed to Columbia Records imprint Ruffhouse in 1992 and immediately cut a promotional single called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Born Loser.\xe2\x80\x9d The track introduced his depressive tone, an ominous and confessional space that would later bring life to his most discomforting scenes. But true to its title, it failed to generate any buzz or airplay, and his overbooked label let him off the hook. (DMX claimed he was under-promoted because of groups like Kris Kross and Cypress Hill.) A few years later, Puff Daddy, head of the burgeoning Bad Boy Records, took interest in X and fellow Yonkers corner boys the LOX, but in the end chose to sign the latter over the former, deciding that X had no commercial prospects. \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I respect about Puff, at least he told me to my face what he felt,\xe2\x80\x9d DMX told \xe2\x80\x9cDrink Champs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His voice is too rough, he\xe2\x80\x99s not marketable.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d DMX returned to the underground scene, emerging on LL Cool J\xe2\x80\x99s 1997 album Phenomenon with a verse on the now infamous posse cut \xe2\x80\x9c4, 3, 2, 1.\xe2\x80\x9d Buzzing once more, he followed Gotti to Def Jam.' b'When Gotti pushed for Def Jam to sign DMX in his first meeting, he got laughed out of the room. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember when I left the office, [A&R executive] Tina Davis said, \xe2\x80\x98if DMX don\xe2\x80\x99t sell, your ass is fired,\xe2\x80\x9d Gotti remembered in an interview with Complex. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to fit with the rap moment. This was a year dominated by Puff Daddy and Bad Boy, who landed six of the seven highest-charting rap songs, delivered a huge critical and commercial success in Harlem World, and won Best Rap Album at the Grammys for the 7x-Platinum album No Way Out (famously and controversially defeating Wu-Tang Clan\xe2\x80\x99s Wu-Tang Forever). Putting money behind DMX would run counter to Bad Boy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cshiny suit\xe2\x80\x9d era of glam rap.' b'But X brought Def Jam executive Lyor Cohen up to Yonkers for an early Ruff Ryder session and convinced him to sign the MC. At the time, DMX\xe2\x80\x99s mouth was wired shut because of an altercation he\xe2\x80\x99d had with some guys he was accused of stealing from. In an interview with DJ Vlad, Ja Rule remembered the ferocity through which he ripped through the wiring: \xe2\x80\x9cHe had got into a fight or somebody got jumped... and he was rhyming with the fuckin\xe2\x80\x99 wires in his mouth. Crazy shit. Like the shit about to pop. I was like \xe2\x80\x98Okay, I like this dude.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d When they left, Cohen turned to Gotti and proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cWe got the pick of the litter.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Through his connections at Bad Boy (namely, his friends the LOX and Ma$e), DMX began working on his debut album with a producer from Harlem named Dame Grease, a fellow Yonkers product named P.K. (or P. Killer Trackz), and Grease\xe2\x80\x99s unknown protege from the Bronx, Swizz Beatz. Under direction from Irv and Lyor, Grease, P.K., and X worked up a single called \xe2\x80\x9cGet at Me Dog\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9997, and released it in February of \xe2\x80\x9998. It functioned as an abrasive prelude, but was at least partially aimed at X\xe2\x80\x99s longtime rival K-Solo. They brought the song to Hot 97 DJ Funkmaster Flex, who aired it and added it to the first volume of his Big Dawgs mixtape. It soon took off, peaking at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 that May. Gotti remembers the video as the turning point: \xe2\x80\x9cWe back to the hood, and X is the leader of this revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d Filmed at New York\xe2\x80\x99s Tunnel nightclub, packed, sweaty, and shot in black and white, X\xe2\x80\x99s crusade is articulated in its opening seconds: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s take it back to the streets, motherfuckers!\xe2\x80\x9d' b'\xe2\x80\x9cGet at Me Dog\xe2\x80\x9d set the stage for It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot, which explores the furthest depths of the human experience. But there is no more fitting introduction to the album than the Swizz Beatz-produced \xe2\x80\x9cRuff Ryders\xe2\x80\x99 Anthem,\xe2\x80\x9d a confrontational, fang-bearing mark of ferocity. The song functions much like a warning shot: Cross this threshold at your own peril. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about to get ugly/Fuck it dog, I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d he snaps. The song was a defining moment for both DMX and Swizz Beatz, but it almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Swizz made the song in Atlanta when he was just a DJ and then moved back to New York to join the Ruff Ryders. DMX didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the song initially, claiming it was some \xe2\x80\x9crock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll track\xe2\x80\x9d and he needed some hip-hop shit: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not doing that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hood enough,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the producer. But Swizz and other members of the Ruff Ryders team pushed him to make the record, and it became the theme song of a movement.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot was not only the springboard for the Ruff Ryders campaign\xe2\x80\x94launching the careers of Swizz Beatz, Eve, Cassidy, and Jin\xe2\x80\x94it was the catalyst for a greater shift on the New York rap scene and beyond. It was a reset button for street rap, setting the stage for runs from 50 Cent and G-Unit and Cam\xe2\x80\x99ron\xe2\x80\x99s Diplomats crew. \xe2\x80\x9cHittin\xe2\x80\x99 niggas with gashes to the head/Straight to the white meat but the street stays red/Girls gave me head for free cause they see/Who I\xe2\x80\x99ma be, by like 2003,\xe2\x80\x9d X rapped on the intro. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t even take that long.' b'Like Dante\xe2\x80\x99s Inferno, DMX\xe2\x80\x99s It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot is a fiendish epic that explores the nature of sin, highlighting acts of violence, wrath, greed, treachery, and lust. The album exposes an internal struggle waged between a man and his demons\xe2\x80\x94a man searching for one light in an all-consuming darkness. He has a talk with god (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Convo\xe2\x80\x9d), but the devil is constantly whispering in his ear and wearing him down. He\xe2\x80\x99s unsure whether his rhyme skills are the product of a contract with the devil (\xe2\x80\x9cI sold my soul to the devil, and the price was cheap\xe2\x80\x9d) or the generosity of a loving creator. It\xe2\x80\x99s this duality that makes up one of the most gripping psychological studies in all of rap lore: What happens when a God-fearing man makes the devil his ally?' b'The centerpiece is \xe2\x80\x9cDamien,\xe2\x80\x9d a winding back-and-forth saga between X and his Hadean accomplice. The album builds to this moment, where X is seduced by his greatest admirer. In the throes of his own greed and pain, DMX embraces wickedness as a fair price for freedom from destitution. By the end, the song becomes a parable about the dangers of giving into desire when Damien coerces X into crimes he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to commit: \xe2\x80\x9cEither do it or give me your right hand, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you said,\xe2\x80\x9d he threatens. \xe2\x80\x9cI see now, ain\xe2\x80\x99t nothing but trouble ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d Traces of \xe2\x80\x9cDamien\xe2\x80\x9d can be heard throughout the \xe2\x80\x9cLucy\xe2\x80\x9d thread on Kendrick Lamar\xe2\x80\x99s To Pimp a Butterfly, which also examines the points where fame and sin meet. (Kendrick has cited It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot as a major influence.) But \xe2\x80\x9cDamien\xe2\x80\x9d is even more tightly wound, the relationship more clearly articulated and its energy more affecting. The dynamic \xe2\x80\x9cDamien\xe2\x80\x9d is a microcosm of It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot, which is either in constant motion or disclosing ongoing conversations\xe2\x80\x94whether internal, interpersonal (\xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s It Goin\xe2\x80\x99 Down\xe2\x80\x9d), or divine (\xe2\x80\x9cPrayer\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot debuted atop the Billboard 200 in May and was certified platinum by June. DMX quickly released his sophomore album, Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood, in December of \xe2\x80\x9998, and it was double platinum by January. In between the two, he starred in Hype Williams\xe2\x80\x99 directorial debut, Belly, alongside Nas, and the film almost immediately became a cult hit among rap fans. So in a grand total of eight months, DMX became the biggest rapper on the planet. His moment was so colossal that in 1999 Jay Z boycotted the Grammy ceremony (the year he won Best Rap Album for Vol. 2\xe2\x80\xa6 Hard Knock Life) because DMX was not nominated.\xc2\xa0As Nas remembered in a 2013 interview with Pitchfork, \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the year DMX took over the world.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Nearly 20 years later, there is still no album like it. So many of the songs on It\xe2\x80\x99s Dark and Hell Is Hot document violent crimes and the flood of emotions they induce. They move swiftly, jerking around corners and through alleyways, simulating a rising heart rate and a racing mind. His peers were shooting stills, but X was dealing in savage action sequences (\xe2\x80\x9cATF\xe2\x80\x9d) and the shadows they cast (\xe2\x80\x9cLet Me Fly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cX-Is Coming\xe2\x80\x9d). Everything about the music\xe2\x80\x94from the harshness of his voice, to the murkiness of his beats, to the bruising nature of his flows\xe2\x80\x94was in service of a supreme hardness. In \xe2\x80\x9898, the biggest MCs on the New York scene were narrators using radically different sounds to tell their stories. Busta erupted with pure energy. Big Pun enchanted with an effortless fluidity. As Wu-Tang swarmed, Tribe was in the midst of their love movement. Black Star were a conscious voice for hood theorists. Jay Z brought business acumen to the drug trade. All were reporting live, sharing their powerful perspectives from different city blocks.' b'But DMX wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a rapper in the trenches; he was a messiah in the gutter, painting a portrait of a community laid desolate by corruption, and the sociopaths its conditions were breeding. He was the voice of the street corners and the graveyards, telling stories of the lost and the damned. From on high, he demanded empathy for man, who were cold to murder and unapologetic for their crimes because he knew it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be good in a world this broken. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between doing wrong and being wrong, and that ain\xe2\x80\x99t right,\xe2\x80\x9d he says on \xe2\x80\x9cLet Me Fly.\xe2\x80\x9d He breaks the moral compass, then drags you into the abyss.' b'CORRECTION: The original version of this review included a quote by Nas that was misleading, misattributing some of his comments about a Lauryn Hill album.'"
b'Clap Your Hands Say Yeah',7.5,b'The Tourist',0,b'Rock',b'March 4 2017',"b'With renewed confidence, focus, and contentment, Alec Ounsworth delivers a consistently satisfying Clap Your Hands album, the best since\xc2\xa0their debut.'","b'Since their 2005 debut, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah have evolved from being an actual band into being just an idea of one. Once a proper quintet, they\xe2\x80\x99ve gradually shed members over the past decade, and after drummer Sean Greenhalgh bailed following 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Only Run, the group was down to one man clapping\xe2\x80\x94lead singer/songwriter Alec Ounsworth. Of course, Ounsworth has been the band\xe2\x80\x99s creative center since the very beginning, and even though he\xe2\x80\x99s released music under his own name, he\xe2\x80\x99s held onto the Clap Your Hands brand\xe2\x80\x94as much for its obfuscating qualities as recognition value. Always too cryptic and theatrical a raconteur to fit the traditional singer-songwriter mold, Clap Your Hands is Ounsworth\xe2\x80\x99s means of holding up a funhouse mirror to it, through restless, combustible songs as elastic and exaggerated as his voice.' b'But even though his original band has effectively fallen apart, Ounsworth has some quality Krazy Glue in the form of Dave Fridmann. The producer has a history of stabilizing bands in a state of flux, whether charting the Flaming Lips\xe2\x80\x99 course out of \xe2\x80\x9cJelly\xe2\x80\x9d-ville, or promoting himself from Mercury Rev\xe2\x80\x99s bassist to their studio-bound sonic architect in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9990s. Fridmann has worked on two very different Clap Your Hands records, both of which bore the pressure of the band\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances at the time: 2007\xe2\x80\x99s infamously cluttered and blown-out Some Loud Thunder was an unsubtle pin-prick to the inflated anticipation that followed their debut; the deconstructed, discombobulated Only Run captured the sound of a shrinking band trying to figure out where to go next. Like the latter record, The Tourist was self-produced by Ounsworth and mixed by Fridmann, but Only Run\xe2\x80\x99s sense of blank-canvas uncertainty has been replaced with renewed confidence, focus, and contentment.' b'The result is the most consistently satisfying Clap Your Hands album since their debut. Ounsworth\xe2\x80\x99s once-adversarial songwriting smarts and sonic ambitions are more in sync than ever before, and Fridmann\xe2\x80\x99s lustrous mix ranges between the intimate and the epic. The Tourist furthers Only Run\xe2\x80\x99s predilection for synth-smeared textures, but the songs here feel less like randomized experiments and more purposefully constructed for dramatic effect: \xe2\x80\x9cA Chance to Cure\xe2\x80\x9d begins in an ambient, after-hours R&B haze but erupts into a blast of psychedelic funk, powered by a hiccupping drumbeat that locks in with Ounsworth\xe2\x80\x99s rap-like repartee; \xe2\x80\x9cDown (is where I want to be)\xe2\x80\x9d is a delirious disco in the spirit of \xe2\x80\x9cSatan Said Dance,\xe2\x80\x9d spiked with Eno-esque harmonies and a surprising rock-out climax that transforms it into the first Clap Your Hands song to make you pump your fist.' b'Ounsworth has said The Tourist was written during a period of personal tumult, and his lyric sheet here is riddled with references to ambulances, drugs, \xe2\x80\x9cvisiting hours,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdark flowers.\xe2\x80\x9d But he works through his woes with sly humor. The charming, organ-poked waltz \xe2\x80\x9cUnfolding Above Celibate Moon (Lost Angeles Nursery Rhyme)\xe2\x80\x9d sees Ounsworth declare, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no good trying to be someone you\xe2\x80\x99re not,\xe2\x80\x9d before building a couplet from quotes of the Velvet Underground\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Your Mirror\xe2\x80\x9d and Broken Social Scene\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Still Your Fag.\xe2\x80\x9d And atop the glistening glide of \xe2\x80\x9cBetter Off,\xe2\x80\x9d he confronts an existential crisis (\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better to keep moving/Better just to hold still\xe2\x80\x9d) with zen-like bliss, rendering a scene of interpersonal turmoil by cribbing the \xe2\x80\x9chit me with a flower\xe2\x80\x9d quip from Lou Reed\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cVicious.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'In spite of The Tourist\xe2\x80\x99s surface shimmer, Ounsworth still wields his frail voice like a weapon, dramatically punctuating his lines with hysterical tics like someone feigning a fainting episode to get out of an uncomfortable situation. But they\xe2\x80\x99re also natural responses to moments when he\xe2\x80\x99s just too overcome with emotion. The heart-rending \xe2\x80\x9cAmbulance Chaser\xe2\x80\x9d surges forth like an acoustic complement to \xe2\x80\x9cIn This Home On Ice,\xe2\x80\x9d its fidgety rhythm emblematic of the unsettling medical drama unfolding in Ounsworth\xe2\x80\x99s motor-mouthed lyrics (\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a limit to how much I can endure/I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my medicine and you\xe2\x80\x99ll just hope for the worst\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'The revitalizing vigor of The Tourist suggests that whatever troubles were plaguing Ounsworth are now behind him, with the post-punk thrust of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Vanity of Trying\xe2\x80\x9d putting the exclamation point on the album\xe2\x80\x99s liberation philosophy when he exclaims, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can be whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever we want!\xe2\x80\x9d A decade ago, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were a modest, rickety band bearing the albatross of hype; today, they\xe2\x80\x99re an amorphous, musically adventurous entity basking in the freedom of no expectations.'"
b'Cameron Graves',7.7,b'Planetary Prince',0,b'Jazz',b'March 4 2017',"b'Cameron Graves, the pianist for Kamasi Washington and a founding member of the West Coast Get Down collective, makes his own searing mark with an enrapturing and assured solo album.'","b'The collective known as the West Coast Get Down may have made its emphatic mark on the jazz world in 2015, but the bandmates have been honing their sound and approach for nearly two decades together in Los Angeles. They\xe2\x80\x99ve put in their Gladwellian 10,000 hours, just not in New York or at Berklee.' b'If tenor saxophonist Kamasi Washington\xe2\x80\x94with his sprawling, uncompromising record The Epic\xe2\x80\x94was the subject of the most column inches in 2015, this may be the year for some of his long-time collaborators like Cameron Graves, a beguiling pianist who just released Planetary Prince, his rousing debut as a bandleader. Fellow WCGD musicians Ryan Porter (trombone), Stephen \xe2\x80\x9cThundercat\xe2\x80\x9d Bruner (bass), drummer Ronald Bruner, Jr., and Kamasi Washington (as a sideman) return for this set, with the addition of trumpeter Philip Dizack and Hadrien Feraud, another bassist, both of whom are immersed in the L.A. jazz scene.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s at once an addendum to The Epic and an extension. It was recorded during an eleven-hour session, and at 80 minutes it has the feel of a concept album, channeling Graves\xe2\x80\x99 interest in astrology and The Urantia Book, the 2,000-page spiritual/science text of unknown provenance that served as inspiration for outr\xc3\xa9 composer Karlheinz Stockhausen\xe2\x80\x99s seven-day opera \xe2\x80\x9cLicht.\xe2\x80\x9d (Jimi Hendrix and Jerry Garcia also carried around copies in their rucksacks.)' b'The authorship of the music, though, is all Graves, who, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported, enjoys death metal and Chopin, hip-hop and prog rock, and has played with Jada Pinkett-Smith\xe2\x80\x99s band Wicked Wisdom and pioneering fusion bassist Stanley Clarke. The eight tracks on the album reveal Graves\xe2\x80\x99 influences, which seem to come from everywhere and nowhere. There are whiffs of McCoy Tyner, especially from his early- mid-\xe2\x80\x9970s groups, Abdullah Ibrahim, and somehow Joe Sample, yet he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly sound like any of them.' b'As a youngster, Graves studied classical piano, which is apparent from the gorgeous opening bars of the first piece, \xe2\x80\x9cSatania Our Solar System,\xe2\x80\x9d before it quickly transitions into an uptempo fusion-esque romp with a charging back beat. In the subsequent title track, Graves, who plays acoustic throughout the set, bursts out in percussive form\xe2\x80\x94he\xe2\x80\x99s often thunderingly percussive, as in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lucifer Rebellion\xe2\x80\x9d later\xe2\x80\x94and follows with a busy, jabbing solo. Washington, with his singular, bravura tone, soon joins and verges on obfuscating the material, but stays just on the right side of his ecstatic-expressionism. \xe2\x80\x9cAndromeda\xe2\x80\x9d shifts to a quieter side, or as quiet as the WCGD can get. Feraud, a Parisian, recalls Jaco Pastorius on an inspired electric bass solo, and Ronald Bruner\xe2\x80\x94who also shimmers on \xe2\x80\x9cEl Diablo\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94coerces all sorts of vibrant colors out of just his cymbals. The theme, especially when played by the horns, has a dream-like touch, as if penned by Wayne Shorter.' b'On \xe2\x80\x9cIsle of Love,\xe2\x80\x9d the leader opens with vigor, before Kamasi returns for another towering solo. Graves takes us out softly and by himself, which is exactly how \xe2\x80\x9cAdam & Eve\xe2\x80\x9d begins. Kamasi lets loose one more time, but the three horns that finish the tune\xe2\x80\x94and Porter\xe2\x80\x99s trombone adds lovely texture here, as it did on The Epic\xe2\x80\x94underscores the unselfishness that marks the work of the WCGD. \xe2\x80\x9cThe End of Corporatism,\xe2\x80\x9d an uptempo piece, further captures the Collective\xe2\x80\x99s (and Graves\xe2\x80\x99) drive and spirit, one that is enraptured, assured, grandiose in moments, but never self-aggrandizing. Planetary Prince might not shift the tectonic plates the way *The Epic *did, but Graves, while earthly-bound, has his gaze set upward.'"
b'Career Suicide',7.5,b'Machine Response',0,b'Rock',b'March 4 2017',"b""The latest from Toronto's self-professed hardcore purists\xc2\xa0animates eleven songs in a style that, what with its limited vocabulary, usually lends itself to sets of four or five.""","b'In the early to mid-2000s, Fucked Up and Career Suicide were cousin groups in the Toronto punk scene. They performed together and shared members Jonah Falco and Mike Haliechuk, and each sounded inspired by the lurch and throttle of 1980s American hardcore. But Career Suicide skewed bratty (sampling punk sendup Repo Man) where Fucked Up went didactic (sampling anti-fascist speeches). And on albums released in 2006, their paths sharply diverged: Fucked Up\xe2\x80\x99s expansive Hidden World*\xc2\xa0*foreshadowed the musical ingenuity and conceptual bombast to come, while Career Suicide\xe2\x80\x99s reverent hardcore sounded more bracingly combustible than ever on Attempted Suicide.' b'*Machine Response, *Career Suicide\xe2\x80\x99s first release since 2008 (aside from a prelude EP of the same name that appeared late last year), shows the rewards of their craftsman-like commitment to a familiar form\xe2\x80\x94hardcore not as a template to expand, or as a style to flee, but as a sort of aspirational ideal. That means the songs are punchy and concise, animated by Falco\xe2\x80\x99s blocky riffs and Martin Farkas\xe2\x80\x99 breathless bark. And it means that though the album careens in expected ways, its delight is akin to watching the staged implosion of a skyscraper: spectacular for its expenditure of energy in the service of wreckage, and no less impressive for occurring right on schedule.' b'Unusually stirring hardcore is more often ramshackle, the result of expression outpacing skill. Experienced players, meanwhile, frequently sacrifice individual personality to cultivate a sense of imposing might; that\xe2\x80\x99s why so much self-consciously extreme hardcore sounds so antiseptic. *Machine Response, *however, slots into neither category. The band members manage to give highlights such as \xe2\x80\x9cTighten the Screws\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBreak Away\xe2\x80\x9d a palpable groove, to swing despite inhospitably brisk tempos. They animate eleven songs in a style that, what with its limited vocabulary, usually lends itself to sets of four or five.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a somewhat contradictory position: exercise creative invention, but mind the strictures of what Machine Response\xe2\x80\x99s promotional material calls \xe2\x80\x9cpurist hardcore.\xe2\x80\x9d Not all of the songs adhere: A bleating horn on the mid-tempo \xe2\x80\x9cTaking You With Me\xe2\x80\x9d evokes Rocket From the Crypt, while the sauntering gait and singsong refrain of \xe2\x80\x9cNo Walls, No Curtains\xe2\x80\x9d sound\xc2\xa0indebted to late-1970s punk. They don\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the album, just the band\xe2\x80\x99s professed purity. For Falco, who writes the music, it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to view Career Suicide\xe2\x80\x99s formal conservatism as a respite from the mercurial whims of Fucked Up.' b""Still, in certain circles, a new Career Suicide is more exciting than a new Fucked Up album. (Farkas supposed, in a recent interview, that the bands hardly share listeners anymore.) This has a lot to do with how critics tacitly devalue hardcore. The style is appreciated, even fetishized, as a background from which bands progress and deemed noteworthy once left behind. It's a paternalistic idea keeps hardcore locked in the past and illegitimate in the present. Career Suicide\xe2\x80\x99s *Machine Response *is one brazen rebuttal to all of that, a swaggering wager on a simple style\xe2\x80\x99s enduring, essential thrills."""

As guitarist Nando Carneiro states in the notes, musicians during this time \xe2\x80\x9chad to stay caught in a cage.\xe2\x80\x9d Emanating from a country increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, these artists put wild blends of electronics, jazz fusion, new age drifts, new-fangled digital drum machines, and traditional Brazilian percussion into a new, curious sound.' b'A trace of Nascimento\xe2\x80\x99s wordless music echoes through Anno Luz\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPor Qu\xc3\xaa,\xe2\x80\x9d as pan flutes get stretched into a cloud and a bright, fingerpicked guitar figure moves in and out of an analog synth haze. Carneiro\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cG.R.E.S. Luxo Artesanal\xe2\x80\x9d also aims for a similar space, wedding his nimble samba phrases to a programmed rhythm and a synth line that slowly becomes unmoored from the beat. Some four minutes in, he splices the tape and the guitar drifts into \xe2\x80\x9cO Campon\xc3\xaas,\xe2\x80\x9d with Carneiro\xe2\x80\x99s non-verbal accompaniment capping the piece with a poignant coda.' b'One of the sets more thrilling juxtapositions is between the hand percussion that\xe2\x80\x99s underpinned Brazilian music for centuries and these stiff new electronic components. Most of these devices had to be smuggled into the country through bribed officials. But even culturally, there was hesitation to have such computers make facsimiles of the lithe Brazilian rhythms. It\xe2\x80\x99s the tangy interplay of hand drum patter and percolating electronics that gives Cinema\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSem Teto\xe2\x80\x9d a soda-pop fizz, suggestive of the similar samba hybrids envisioned a hemisphere away by bands like Antenna.' b'And as the military regime fell asunder and artists regained their voices, so did the music begin to expand and change. The other dialogue flowing through Outro Tempo is between Brazilian artists as they began to interact not just with one another, but with the indigenous tribes in Amazonia endangered by rampant deforestation going on during that decade. Some composers traveled to the jungle so as to better interact with these ancient sounds. Ben\xc3\xa9 Fonteles\xe2\x80\x99 haunted \xe2\x80\x9cO M M\xe2\x80\x9d chants that sacred Hindu syllable, strikes chimes, and shakes rattles until it resembles the clatter of the rainforest, while Maria Rita couples her powerful voice with tribal percussion and electric bass on \xe2\x80\x9cC\xc3\xa2ntico Brasileiro No.3.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'The most stunning compositions come from Priscilla Ermel, represented by the two longest cuts on the compilation. During the \xe2\x80\x9980s, Ermel traveled into the rainforest to immerse herself in study of these vanishing indigenous forms, seeking to fuse it with her own sensibilities as a musician and composer. But rather than just conduct a simple integration of ancient and modern, she also reaches outside of her country for other timbres, suggesting a \xe2\x80\x9cworld music\xe2\x80\x9d more holistic than such a tag implies. Across the nine-minute \xe2\x80\x9cGestos de Equil\xc3\xadbrio,\xe2\x80\x9d she interweaves guitar, synth, oboe and clay pot drums, but also makes foreign objects like the banjo, kalimba and Indian stringed-instrument the dilruba all sound right at home on her gently undulating ambient piece. Even more formidable is her 15-minute masterwork, \xe2\x80\x9cCorpo do Vento.\xe2\x80\x9d Across a thundering battery of bombo and cultrun, Ermel breathes through ocarina, Chilean chirimia and Nepalese flute, giving the epic a ritualistic vibration. She judiciously adds piano and viola caipira and the middle section drifts into new age territory before returning to the drum-driven mesmerism of the final passage.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are portals through which stories, people, and cultures can be revealed,\xe2\x80\x9d Ermel explains in the album\xe2\x80\x99s liner notes about how she perceives her music. And almost every track here resonates like a secret kept silent for decades. Outro Tempo opens up a portal for us in the present moment back to a time and place where \xe2\x80\x94under the suffocating weight of a totalitarian state\xe2\x80\x94a few brave musicians nevertheless could hear the sounds of a brighter world.'"

After a splashy, very public relationship with the singer Ciara, the two had a splashy, very public breakup that spilled from the courts and onto Twitter. In its wake, Future measured his pain into cups of codeine-spiked soda and poured it all over his music, most notably on 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Dirty Sprite 2. Dudes who lived vicariously through him dredged up all sorts of relationship trauma in order to wail alongside him, once more with feeling.' b'After DS2\xe2\x80\x99s 4 a.m. drive through the desert, Future cartwheeling back into the heart-clutching love songs and sweet-street persona of his 2012 debut, Pluto, might have been jarring.

By the time an organ warbles onto the song, he\xe2\x80\x99s spent, his heart wrung dry. The shivery chorus begins to fade, and birds start chirping.

The sun burns the edges of the clouds without entirely breaking through, which feels more honest, anyway.' b""The old clich\xc3\xa9 is that artists produce better work when they're in pain, and it did seem like the deeper Future sank, the higher his star rose. Appreciating that without romanticizing or wallowing in his despair is key, as is allowing him freedom to create from a different emotional vantage point. As Charles Bukowski wrote in \xe2\x80\x9cLet It Enfold You\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cEither peace or happiness,/Let it enfold you/When I was a young man/I felt these things were/Dumb, unsophisticated.\xe2\x80\x9d"" b'But Bukowski got that first part wrong. Peace and happiness do not simply \xe2\x80\x9cenfold\xe2\x80\x9d you. Sadness spreads like weeds, and channeling that into your music is a means of purging it so it won\xe2\x80\x99t choke you. It\xe2\x80\x99s joy that requires constant tending to grow. With HNDRXX, Future did just that, venturing back into the day for some fresh air with his woman who\xe2\x80\x99s frying bacon. The sand\xe2\x80\x99s like flour between their toes, and the music feels just fine.'"

But the NYC band\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0shakiness has long\xc2\xa0been key to their shredded charm.\xc2\xa0Since 2009, frontman Justin Frye has led shifting lineups through genre calisthenics rigorous\xc2\xa0enough that their repertoire encompasses way-out freak-flag jams, garage punk shimmy, and a *Fraggle Rock *cover, among other oddities. PC Worship stumble and shamble the way collectives like Harlem\xe2\x80\x99s No-Neck Blues Band or Finland\xe2\x80\x99s Avarus might if Captain Beefheart were sitting in. The PC Worship Experience is uncertain, splintered, alive, and never lacking in bristling forward momentum.' b'This makes\xc2\xa0the first song on *Buried Wish *a bit of\xc2\xa0a head-scratcher.

Stoner metal dirge \xe2\x80\x9cBack of My $$$\xe2\x80\x9d crawls forward like lava under the weight of gnashing guitars. Grease fire psychedelia and 1980s Lower East Side scum-rock collide on the sneering, accessible \xe2\x80\x9cBlank Touch.\xe2\x80\x9d Almost everywhere else here, though, the band embraces the spare or the stripped back.\xe2\x80\x9cTranq,\xe2\x80\x9d a piano curio that morphs into a pummeling\xc2\xa0krautrock interlude, achieves the effect of its title.' b'The title track gently hoists a sitar-like frequency higher and higher up into the stratosphere before allowing it to plummet back down to earth in a storm of effects. Vertiginously anemic, the delirious \xe2\x80\x9cHelp\xe2\x80\x9d thumbtacks atonal string whinny with spoken word. \xe2\x80\x9cTorched\xe2\x80\x9d carpets spindled guitars with constantly erupting drum rolls, like *Standards-*era Tortoise sound-checking.

b'Aseethe',6.0,b'Hopes of Failure',0,b'Rock',b'March 3 2017',b'The Iowa City doom trio\xe2\x80\x99s latest streamlines their approach. It lacks the subtleties that distinguished their previous work.',"b'Though Aseethe identify as a doom act, the prominent noise samples on 2011 debut\xc2\xa0Reverent Burden showed that the Iowa City trio was trying to do more than just sludgeon its audience into submission. Aseethe have since recorded an improv\xc2\xa0album, a suite of re-worked riffs by avant-doom duo Barn Owl, an EP featuring synth accompaniment, and a rendition of Black Sabbath\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRat Salad\xe2\x80\x9d stretched and slowed beyond recognition. Across that entire body of work, Aseethe maintained an\xc2\xa0atmosphere and textures verging on ambient drone.' b'On\xc2\xa0Hopes of Failure, Aseethe shed their sound\xe2\x80\x99s flaky outer layers in favor of ultra-dense riffs that creep by like boiling molasses. True, they built Reverent Burden on similarly solid riffing, but this time they offer less in the way of\xc2\xa0sonic detail. The new album\xe2\x80\x94four tunes ranging from eight-and-a-half to 14 minutes\xe2\x80\x94drones on without the subtleties that distinguished Aseethe in the first place. And because it lacks the space and sweep of their previous work,\xc2\xa0Hopes of Failure marginalizes the industrial-metal gloom furnished by drummer Eric Diercks\xe2\x80\x99 samples.' b'The new material doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reward the patience of letting the songs unfold nearly as effectively as this band always has. Diehard doom aficionados will likely appreciate Hopes of Failure as a purposeful trimming of extraneous fat. But it\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling that Aseethe would choose to recast themselves as something of a conventional doom band at this stage, after repeatedly demonstrating that there\xe2\x80\x99s more to what they do.' b'It would be one thing if the fidelity of the recording could approximate\xc2\xa0the sensation of standing in front of amplifier cabinets, having\xc2\xa0your chest rattled by the sheer density of sound. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that the recording is necessarily flat, but Hopes of Failure doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything we haven\xe2\x80\x99t already heard after decades\xe2\x80\x99 worth of tone-obsessed artists getting better and better at capturing on mic the way speaker cones move air through a room. Compared to 2014\xe2\x80\x99s Burdens II, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost shocking how little Hopes of Failure conveys a sense of the band in a physical setting.' b'At times, the album does hint at the\xc2\xa0wrinkles Aseethe have added to doom. \xe2\x80\x9cBarren Soil,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, begins with a Danny Barr bassline so deep it seems to dip toward subsonic frequencies. That said, every note is audible and you can actually hum along to the melody\xe2\x80\x94no small feat when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with timbres that tend to smother pitch. And in a dramatic departure for the band, Barr also sings a clean verse on closing track \xe2\x80\x9cInto the Sun.\xe2\x80\x9d After Barr and his brother, guitarist and founder Brian Barr, have spent a half hour barking, the shift to relatively melodic vocals enhances the album\xe2\x80\x99s acerbic mood.' b'But the band opts not to emphasize\xc2\xa0these features. Stripped of its usual dimension, Aseethe\xe2\x80\x99s music consigns the Barr brothers\xe2\x80\x99 lyrics to the realm of unremarkable negativity. Clearly, Aseethe have made a concerted effort to streamline their approach, but Hopes of Failure only underscores how much better off they are when they stick to their guns. As such, it functions best as a gateway to a more colorful back catalog.'"
b'Dams of the West',4.6,b'Youngish American',0,b'Rock',b'March 3 2017',b'The hapless solo debut from the Vampire Weekend drummer is excruciatingly self-reflexive.',"b'This solo debut of Vampire Weekend drummer Chris Tomson was born three years ago, when the band took a break after touring behind 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Modern Vampires of the City. Tomson, who had just turned 30, got married and got a mortgage. Less typically for someone his age, Tomson was also staring at what he called \xe2\x80\x9ca fairly large amount of time off.\xe2\x80\x9d He had his childhood piano moved from his parents\xe2\x80\x99 house in New Jersey to his basement in Brooklyn, and\xe2\x80\x94after \xe2\x80\x9cprobably two months watching sports and then two months staring blankly\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94started writing these songs.' b'He went with the name Dams of the West because of an article debating whether the dams in western America have outlived their usefulness and, \xe2\x80\x9cas a straight, white man playing generally rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll music\xe2\x80\x9d in 2017, \xe2\x80\x9cfelt a certain camaraderie with the crumbling infrastructure from the middle of the last century.\xe2\x80\x9d He uses this acute awareness of his place in life as a vehicle to muse about the droll scenes that play out in his narrow range of vision. Its effect on almost every level\xe2\x80\x94political, social, artistic\xe2\x80\x94is essentially useless.' b'The muddle of Youngish American begins with the music. As the rhythmic force on three of the most critically adored albums of the past decade, Tomson knows his way around the drum kit. He also deftly plays almost all of the instruments on Youngish American. But his mellow voice is affectless, even with\xc2\xa0Black Keys\xe2\x80\x99 Patrick Carney as producer. Carney\xe2\x80\x99s touch on the record is serviceable, keeping the reverb gauzy and the percussion brawny, similar to his work with bands like Tennis and Black Lips. However, at some point, it was mistakenly suggested these songs should include swooping violin runs behind Tomson\xe2\x80\x99s showy, clumsy lyrics.' b'Those lyrics dream oh so big of mixing Courtney Barnett\xe2\x80\x99s knack for detail with Father John Misty\xe2\x80\x99s ironic self-awareness. As a rule, the less comically winking they are, the better Tomson comes off. It\xe2\x80\x99s charming when he sings \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care where your heart is at/Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s right where Sinatra sat,\xe2\x80\x9d on the slower, statelier \xe2\x80\x9cPolo Grounds,\xe2\x80\x9d named after the long-gone home of baseball\xe2\x80\x99s New York Giants.' b'But other mundanities are delivered with such a dearth of meaning or poetry that they simply become mundane. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Inerrancy of You and Me\xe2\x80\x9d hops from cooking \xe2\x80\x9cpasta with the red sauce/When I know you\xe2\x80\x99re PMSing\xe2\x80\x9d to using the titular word Tomson says he recently just learned. The woozy ballad \xe2\x80\x9cFlag on the Can\xe2\x80\x9d repeats a half-baked question about Bud Light\xc2\xa0packaging, then adds, after what could only be a rip from some comically oversized bong, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is philosophy, anyway?\xe2\x80\x9d Wine and personal finance are actually recurring themes across the album.' b'Like the least charming aspects of Father John Misty or late-career Sun Kil Moon, Tomson\xe2\x80\x99s self-reflexiveness is exhausting. The fuzzed-out \xe2\x80\x9cPretty Good WiFi\xe2\x80\x9d describes noticing a person\xe2\x80\x99s legs and then having to realize, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, shit, the male gaze!\xe2\x80\x9d A fairly representative track lyrically is the spaciously arranged \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect Wave,\xe2\x80\x9d which mostly involves the protagonist talking about vintage Pittsburgh Pirates baseball with his father-in-law, but then realizing he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need \xe2\x80\x9cthe coldest fridge in the city\xe2\x80\x9d because the grocery store is so close. Tomson has said the line was inspired by a radio story that \xe2\x80\x9cmade me feel like I took both my fridge and proximity to infinite foodstuffs for granted.\xe2\x80\x9d It just goes on like this.' b'The real pathos comes from how affable and intelligent Tomson comes across in interviews, and the real tragedy is that he simply might\xe2\x80\x99ve benefited from testing the waters on a couple of EPs. The anxiety Tomson has acknowledged about becoming the last Vampire Weekend-er to go solo is understandable: VW frontman Ezra Koenig parlayed a Yeah Yeah Yeahs in-joke into a Beyonc\xc3\xa9 songwriting credit; Rostam, who officially quit the group early last year, left his bold stamp on songs by Solange and Frank Ocean when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t collaborating with the Walkmen\xe2\x80\x99s Hamilton Leithauser. Bassist Chris Baio was releasing glinting synth-pop under his own surname for several years before he delivered his debut album, 2015\xe2\x80\x99s The Names.' b'Vampire Weekend have been working on a fourth album. When Tomson returns as a solo artist, it\xe2\x80\x99d be better if he first had something he felt an urgent need to say, and then decided to make a record of it. Youngish American is a hapless vanity album, sad for all the wrong reasons, and all the more frustrating because it couches wokeness in songs about the extra advantages afforded to Tomson\xe2\x80\x99s demographic.\xc2\xa0Issues of privilege and identity are complicated no matter your tax bracket, but it\xe2\x80\x99s better\xc2\xa0to seek inspiration from without rather than from within.'"

It\xe2\x80\x99s victorious\xe2\x80\x94even when her\xc2\xa0feats\xc2\xa0feel pyrrhic. Her soaring, winsome, and mutable tenor is unlike any of her peers in the New York scene. She also shreds. More importantly, Tamko\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0first proper album is a stunning document of what indie rock can look like from a viewpoint that isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily widespread in the genre. *Infinite Worlds *is an album interested in grappling with seemingly intractable and very personal questions about sharing space, finding a home, and fostering community in a world that can be caustic to those very actions.' b'Some of the songs that appear on Infinite Worlds started as rougher drafts on 2014 EP Persian Garden.\xc2\xa0Listening to the earlier work, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear\xc2\xa0how much Tamko has grown. She moved to New York as a teenager from Cameroon, and until she graduated from college in 2015, music was more or less a hobby. Her Bandcamp demos eventually led her to the Bushwick\xc2\xa0community art space Silent Barn, and a venerable DIY scene that includes artists like Frankie Cosmos and Crying (members of both bands contributed to Infinite Worlds).' b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Embers,\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s opener, was originally a song called \xe2\x80\x9cSharks,\xe2\x80\x9d and it has transitioned from whispered confession to empowering paean. The song\xe2\x80\x99s anthemic, steady guitars and booming drums recall the sound of Modest Mouse or Built to Spill, but her voice is the anchor to all these songs. It\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful tool that can move from soft to loud, confrontational to relaxing, with an uncanny grace.' b""Tamko\xc2\xa0shows\xc2\xa0this in songs like \xe2\x80\x9cFear & Force\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMal \xc3\xa0\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x80\x99aise.\xe2\x80\x9d On the former, she sings about a failed relationship, isolation, and the search for a sanctuary. \xe2\x80\x9cI've been hiding in the smallest space/I am dying to go/This is not my home,\xe2\x80\x9d Tamko sings, alternating\xc2\xa0between breathy harmonies and straightforward delivery (Greta Kline, aka Frankie Cosmos, provides backing vocals). The latter is one of the most interesting songs on the album: a piece of gauzy, ambient pop, not unlike the Cocteau Twins. Sung completely in French, \xe2\x80\x9cMal \xc3\xa0\xc2\xa0L\xe2\x80\x99aise\xe2\x80\x9d is a sound collage made of a spectral chorus of voices, processed and multiplied\xc2\xa0(including sampled vocals from Julie Byrne/Makonnen collaborator\xc2\xa0Eric Littmann). These sounds shuffle around in an indistinct musical space, which is both haunted and relaxed. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost close to new age, conjuring up the work of Harold Budd or Grouper, but Tamko gives the airy vibe of this song weight with lyrics that touch on accepting social discomfort and embracing oneself."" b'Throughout Infinite Worlds, Tamko interrogates what it means to occupy space with others who don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily see eye to eye, be it parents, peers, or strangers. Sometimes imagining that ideal world leads to bouts of doubt, or even magical realism (see \xe2\x80\x9c100 Days\xe2\x80\x9d). But Tamko\xc2\xa0keeps coming back to the same point: the community you want to live in is one you have to make. Guided by a more mature sound, *Infinite Worlds *is the rock music we need nowadays, when it seems like home, wherever it might be, is getting farther away.'"

St. Louis is also a gifted vocalist\xe2\x80\x94during \xe2\x80\x9cRain Dance,\xe2\x80\x9d a glittering, four-minute head-nod symphony, he tumbles into the track from above, shaking the walls with a wail that nods to the Temptations in the early \xe2\x80\x9970s."" b""Live-band hip-hop has cycled back into the mainstream again after more than a decade in the cold behind acts like Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper. Though in modern pop, rising tides do not lift all boats. It's not clear if the success of the Kendricks and the Chances means that other rappers with a comparable approach can ride their coattails and\xc2\xa0enjoy the benefits of more listeners without needing to compromise their methods. Having support from gatekeepers helps with that process, and at least one gatekeeper is listening to Oddisee: \xe2\x80\x9cLike Really\xe2\x80\x9d premiered on Ebro's Beats 1 program. But Oddisee has bigger fish to fry. Frequently on The Iceberg, characters seem stuck in entrenched paths dictated by America's racist history, and the album ends at a stand-off. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can't agree on a thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Oddisee raps on \xe2\x80\x9cRights and Wrongs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWe both are beyond the games/But we still play.\xe2\x80\x9d"""
b'Sherwood & Pinch',6.7,b'Man Vs. Sofa',0,b'Electronic',b'March 2 2017',b'Dub pioneer Adrian Sherwood reteams with dubstep pioneer Rob Ellis (aka Pinch) for a more refined and surprising album that falls just short of its desired concept.',"b'Thankfully, the past few years have brought the exhilarating and acerbic production work of Adrian Sherwood back into earshot. In the midst of early \xe2\x80\x9980s London, he helped a slew of punks\xe2\x80\x94the Fall, Judy Nylon, and Maximum Joy\xe2\x80\x94find their inner dub sound, and he gave rastas like Bim Sherman and Prince Far I a heavily psychedelic bass tone that made them stand apart from their dreadlocked brethren. A tireless work ethic and decades of production work make it near impossible to keep a handle on the man, but a spate of reissues in the past few years, especially Sherwood at the Controls, show just how his sound anticipated the wooly electronic experimentation that now runs through the likes of Arca, the Fade to Mind crew and dubstep itself.' b'So having Sherwood team with dubstep pioneer Rob Ellis, aka Pinch, was surely inspired. But too often on their 2015 debut, Late Night Endless, felt cluttered and claustrophobic. And when they did take their foot off the gas, they wound up wallowing in a downtempo rut. The tempos remain quickened on their follow-up Man Vs. Sofa, but the two let the tracks breathe a bit more and there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of refinement throughout. A jittery thump opens \xe2\x80\x9cRoll Call,\xe2\x80\x9d and while there\xe2\x80\x99s all manner of machine-gun handclaps, echoing hi-hats and arroyos of bass, there\xe2\x80\x99s also flecks of Blaxploitation guitar and cinematic strings. It might read like a laundry list of elements, but Pinch and Sherwood move deftly between it all.' b""\xe2\x80\x9cItchy Face\xe2\x80\x9d bears quick electro bass pulses and snare rolls. So when they introduce a graceful piano line and just let it luxuriate, it's like a sonic speedball. The two are so nimble and\xc2\xa0compatible\xc2\xa0now that they easily swing into echo chambers and white noise while keeping the speed up. That piano crosses over to the dubstep/classic dub stylings of \xe2\x80\x9cMidnight Mindset,\xe2\x80\x9d though it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same easy blend they displayed earlier. And the title track has piano and drums flicker in and out of darkness, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t move so much as get swallowed up by static. And when the piano rises up again on the next track, the novelty of it in their mix wears thin."" b'The best surprise comes when they bring Lee \xe2\x80\x9cScratch\xe2\x80\x9d Perry in for a\xc2\xa0guest vocal turn on \xe2\x80\x9cLies.\xe2\x80\x9d Despite decades of dub pedigree, Sherwood and Pinch forego it to instead put a tricky 2-step under him, a welcome shift in strategy. A furious lyric adds menace to the industrial haze of \xe2\x80\x9cGun Law,\xe2\x80\x9d showing the duo moving into noisier terrain that brings to mind Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s gnarled mid-\xe2\x80\x9980s output.' b'Things get baffling when the duo throw in a cover of Ryuichi Sakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s evocative \xe2\x80\x9980s classic, \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas Mr. Lawrence.\xe2\x80\x9d The first time through, they pay their respects to Sakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s sterling piano melody, one of the loveliest soundtrack themes of the era. But after establishing the motif, Sherwood and Pinch don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know quite where to take it. A downtempo beat gets thrown underneath it, before the two grind the track to a complete halt and instead add squalls of digital glitch and some electric guitar noodling. It then goes up into the stratosphere for a moment before they bring it back down with a needlessly busy IDM drum line. Respectable as it is for both men to avoid falling back into their bag of dub tricks, a few of Man Vs. Sofa\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to expand their reach fall just a bit short.'"
b'Karriem Riggins',7.3,b'Headnod Suite',0,b'Rap',b'March 2 2017',"b""After laying out the template for Common's latest album, the drummer/producer offers up another hour-long selection of more than two dozen expertly-made beats that are just waiting to be rapped\xc2\xa0on.""","b""The veteran beatmaker had a banner year in 2016, executive producing Common\xe2\x80\x99s Black America Again, providing the blueprint for Kanye West\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c30 Hours,\xe2\x80\x9d and collaborating with Kaytranada, Esperanza Spalding, and the Roots. Four years after Karriem Riggins' first solo endeavor, Alone Together**, put him on the map as more than just a standout session musician, Riggins\xe2\x80\x99 musical life seemed richer than ever."" b""Alone Together's sequel, the new\xc2\xa0Headnod Suite,\xc2\xa0echoes the template laid out by its predecessor. The record is, again, a nearly hour-long selection of more than two dozen expertly-made beats, seemingly linked by very little other than the fact that Riggins considered them strong enough to make the album. There\xe2\x80\x99s one exception on *Headnod\xe2\x80\x94*about two-thirds of the way through the record, a set of tracks form a mini-suite that stands as a short detour before we return to regularly scheduled swing programming."" b'These tracks, part of the \xe2\x80\x9cCheap Suite,\xe2\x80\x9d are the most cohesive section of the larger record. They are roomier, more experimental, and they lead Headnod Suite\xc2\xa0into more interesting territory, as Riggins explores rhythm-and-space-led compositions reminiscent of the work of Deantoni Parks. Though they are harsher and less soulful than much of what precedes them, these tracks work as a unified experience. Moreover, once you listen to them, you note the trail of breadcrumbs from earlier in the album (\xe2\x80\x9cInvasion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDirty Drum Warm Up\xe2\x80\x9d) that heralded their arrival.' b'Elsewhere, Riggins focuses on rolling out gem after gem, with careful thought given to the little details that distinguish a cubic zirconia from a diamond. Riggins is such an expert drummer that it can be hard to identify him as having any kind of percussive signature. These features\xe2\x80\x94the perfectly chopped sample over the tiptoe-light beat on \xe2\x80\x9cSista Misses,\xe2\x80\x9d the atmospherics and perfectly placed guitar riff on \xe2\x80\x9cOther Side of the Track,\xe2\x80\x9d the clatters and snaps that open \xe2\x80\x9cBahia Dreamin,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d the complex bass work underlying the candy-sweet, teased-out melody on \xe2\x80\x9cCrystal Stairs\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94give him his voice as a producer.' b'Riggins\xe2\x80\x99 abiding love for hip-hop is showcased throughout Headnod Suite. On \xe2\x80\x9cNever Come Close,\xe2\x80\x9d a selection of Prodigy\xe2\x80\x99s verse from \xe2\x80\x9cShook Ones Pt. II\xe2\x80\x9d leads out of the track as if it were a final showstopping instrumental flourish, while on \xe2\x80\x9cKeep It On,\xe2\x80\x9d Common\xe2\x80\x99s ad-libs are swaddled in a steady beat and warm instrumentation, like a beloved child. Even the interludes that Riggins commits to exploring throughout the record come off as a tribute to the skits and exclamations that adorn rap albums\xe2\x80\x94little breaks where vocals communicate an attitude and sense of place.' b'Though there are few beats here that miss the mark, the big issue is that Riggins has trouble editing his cuts down to a standard length. They regularly sprawl beyond the two-minute mark and sometimes even make it to three. In an interview with XXL, he expressed that one of the big differences between Headnod Suite and Alone Together was that the new album contained more \xe2\x80\x9cstuff MCs will want to rap to.\xe2\x80\x9d True, some of the tracks seem gratuitously extended in order to coax rappers into adopting them, giving them a home on their own projects. You can\xe2\x80\x99t blame Riggins for wanting more spotlight. His turn on Black America Again\xc2\xa0gave Common the template for what was arguably his strongest record in more than a decade. Coming off that success, and his many other impressive collaborations, Headnod scans as a beat tape in the classic sense: welcoming to all listeners, but meant to convey something particularly special for those who might help Riggins take his career even further.'"
b'Power Trip',8.4,b'Nightmare Logic',1,b'Metal',b'March 1 2017',"b'Power Trip embody a\xc2\xa0platonic ideal of heavy metal escapism. With more focus\xc2\xa0on detail, the Dallas thrashers push their second\xc2\xa0LP\xc2\xa0over the edge, balancing\xc2\xa0modern intricacy and old-school aggression.'","b'No one throws a party like Power Trip. In the years since their 2008 inception, the Dallas crossover quintet has come to embody the platonic ideal of heavy metal escapism, in person and on record. Genre boundaries get blown to smithereens during their rambunctious, pretension-free concerts; they\xe2\x80\x99ll play with anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to get noisy, be it New Orleans bounce queen Big Freedia, moody post-punk outfit Merchandise, or black metal darlings Deafheaven. Power Trip\xe2\x80\x99s excellent debut album, 2013\xe2\x80\x99s Manifest Decimation, further solidified this\xc2\xa0reputation by translating their live ferocity to wax. One album on, nine years in, Power Trip have mastered the rager. They now turn their focus to widespread revelry\xc2\xa0with Nightmare *Logic\xe2\x80\x94*a mission that goes off with a big, beautiful bang.' b'*Nightmare Logic *doesn\xe2\x80\x99t find Power Trip making any significant shifts to the no-holds-barred approach they showcased so powerfully on their debut. It\xe2\x80\x99s an LP crafted in its predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s literal spitting image, from the proliferative gang vocals and thrash beatdowns right down to the eight-track runtime and gory old-school artwork. Frontman Riley Gale still huffs, puffs, and howls like a rabid wolf, a feral intermediary through which the band issues blistering, occasionally loony\xc2\xa0indictments of corrupt politicians (\xe2\x80\x9cRuination\xe2\x80\x9d) and greedy, polluting CEOs (\xe2\x80\x9cIf Not Us Then Who\xe2\x80\x9d). Gale\xe2\x80\x99s bandmates match these screeds with litanies of their own: particularly guitarist Blake Ibanez, a hardcore titan (and occasional shoegazer) whose slithering riffs incessantly run amok. Even the audience can\xe2\x80\x99t escape Power Trip\xe2\x80\x99s leaden\xc2\xa0censure. On \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting Around to Die,\xe2\x80\x9d Gale delivers this sputtering, incendiary pep talk with a rage so palpable you can almost feel it shaking you by the shoulders: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re waiting around to die, how can you live with it?/Just waiting around to die, AND I CAN\xe2\x80\x99T FUCKING STAND IT!!!\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Thrash has always been a goofy genre with a morbid sense of humor: a direct consequence of the genre\xe2\x80\x99s primordial days in the Reagan era, when trolling the silent majority doubled as a pre-eminent past-time and a form of protest. Like their peers Iron Reagan and Skeletonwitch, Power Trip view the impending apocalypse as a cause for celebration, powered by schadenfreude. Evangelical Christians are treated to particularly hilarious roastings. \xe2\x80\x9cExecutioner\xe2\x80\x99s Tax (Swing of the Axe),\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s best song, sees Gale calling the bluff of all those Bible-Belters who\xe2\x80\x99d so passionately pleaded for the arrival of the man upstairs, only to come face-to-face with the titular killer-for-hire when the End of Days finally arrives. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve prayed for so long, and now you have your chance/The executioner\xe2\x80\x99s here, and he\xe2\x80\x99s sharpening his axe!\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Power Trip\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0new\xc2\xa0attention to detail pushes\xc2\xa0Nightmare Logic\xc2\xa0over the edge. It\xe2\x80\x99s abundantly clear that they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent hours at the dissection table with Manifest Decimation, amplifying\xe2\x80\x94but not recycling\xe2\x80\x94its best hooks and theatrics, trimming off the static scar tissue. They\xe2\x80\x99ve chopped a\xc2\xa0few seconds of extraneous riffing here, a repeated breakdown there; it\xe2\x80\x99s an impressive operation, considering their debut was plenty lean and mean. The nit-picking pays off, as Nightmare Logic outmatches the preceding LP across all verticals, from cohesion and catchiness to impact and atmosphere.' b'The band\xe2\x80\x99s secret weapon remains producer and Sumerlands guitarist Arthur Rizk, or as I like to call him, the Ariel Rechtshaid of heavy music;\xc2\xa0Code Orange\xe2\x80\x99s *Forever\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0Prurient\xe2\x80\x99s Frozen Niagara Falls\xc2\xa0*are just two of the bevy of ambitious records he\xe2\x80\x99s worked on. A master of dynamic contrast and sonic feints, Rizk\xe2\x80\x99s the textbook definition of a board-wizard. Under his command, Ibanez\xe2\x80\x99s already-huge tremolo riffs on \xe2\x80\x9cExecutioner\xe2\x80\x99s Tax\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cFiring Squad,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0and the title track\xc2\xa0become hulking, like a stampede of hellish racehorses against the thundering backbeat. Meanwhile, in the back of the mix, the rhythm section ebbs and flows to accommodate the axework, ensuring sustained impact\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0easy passage from one ripper to the next. Rizk again runs Gale\xe2\x80\x99s yelps through a heap of effects, rendering every syllable an echo-laden boom from on high. And in spite of its sheer heft, Rizk\xc2\xa0makes\xc2\xa0Nightmare Logic\xc2\xa0a crisp, nuanced listen; like the band themselves, he strikes a rare balance between modern intricacy and old-school aggression, nodding to tradition without over-relying on tropes.' b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be a metalhead to have a blast with Nightmare Logic. Screamed sardonics, persistent chug, and apocalyptic melodrama are all acquired tastes, sure. But Power Trip\xe2\x80\x99s fist-pumping choruses, ricocheting grooves, and ample charm are so animated that they leave\xc2\xa0us with something addictive and, well, fun. Just like Metallica, the Texans pitch a big tent, where the only prerequisite for entry is a\xc2\xa0willingness to splash around in the bloodbath for half an hour. With\xc2\xa0Nightmare Logic, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance you\xe2\x80\x99ll stick around for a good, long soak.'"

For a decade, nearly every word that has come out of the Los Campesinos! singer\xe2\x80\x99s mouth has presented itself with rash inelegance, candidness, and the need to be ejected from his body this very second. But sometimes, as anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s stared down the depths of a toilet bowl knows, vomit is just vomit. Like that time he sang of an awkward hookup that was blown when a girl upchucked all over his rented tuxedo; or when he recounted that early heartbreak when he got wasted, ate too many potato chips, and then deposited the greasy snack right back onto a soccer field. For Gareth, such trials are the punchline to humanity\xe2\x80\x99s cruel joke. They are essential experiences, embarrassments that turn into collective elation once they hit open air. Because, for all its indecency, throwing up makes us feel better.' b'Sick Scenes, the British group\xe2\x80\x99s sixth album, plays like a love letter to aging indie idealism; to the fans who have reveled in this band\xe2\x80\x99s careening pop-punk singalongs, scathing neuroses, and charmingly specific soccer references. There is yet another ode to semi-digestion here\xc2\xa0when Gareth advises: \xe2\x80\x9cSave your epiphanies\xe2\x80\xa6 for chucking up in your own hands.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s unconventional wisdom from a man who would know, and the line hints at a weathered sageness that lingers throughout. On the prescription ode \xe2\x80\x9c5 Flucloxacillin,\xe2\x80\x9d the drums drop out to spotlight the singer\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0oh-so-specific stasis as he laments, \xe2\x80\x9cAnother blister pack pops, but I still feel much the same\xe2\x80\x9431 and depression is a young man\xe2\x80\x99s game.\xe2\x80\x9d At that, stalwart musical leader Tom Campesinos! peals off a 15-second guitar solo to lift spirits enough for the next verse.' b'Given the financial gauntlet nearly every independent band must face in 2017, it seems like a\xc2\xa0minor miracle that Los Campesinos! still exist at all. And nobody knows this more than Los Campesinos! A large part of their enduring appeal\xe2\x80\x94remember, they began as a MySpace band\xe2\x80\x94has to do with the fact that they were never especially trendy. Too sugary for the emo diehards, too tart for the indie bandwagoners, too emo for the cool kids. Their target audience could be as particular as one of Gareth\xe2\x80\x99s excruciating tales of broken romance, but also just as passionate; strength in small numbers.' b'To fund the making of Sick Scenes, the band sold about a thousand soccer jerseys with the word \xe2\x80\x9cDOOMED\xe2\x80\x9d scrawled across the chest. Their message could not be clearer: This is a team, and you are part of it. The idea plays out in one of the record\xe2\x80\x99s most touching moments, near the end of manic-panic crack up \xe2\x80\x9cI Broke Up In Amarante,\xe2\x80\x9d when Gareth starts a hook on his own, but soon\xc2\xa0stalls out. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to need you to help me out here,\xe2\x80\x9d he mutters, and a full chorus of voices enter to winningly finish a song about the inevitability of defeat.' b""Recorded amid the harsh realities of Brexit, Sick Scenes\xc2\xa0faintly opens up its miserabilia\xc2\xa0to bring in the wider world. These are not anthems of woke-ness, but Gareth\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment and anger don't sound\xc2\xa0quite as rash; he\xe2\x80\x99s been around long enough to reflect upon many\xc2\xa0sad cycles. Nowhere is this more apparent than on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fall of Home,\xe2\x80\x9d this band\xe2\x80\x99s most beautifully heart-crushing song to date. Backed by little more than a cello, a violin, and some plinking piano notes, Gareth gets to the core of Western society\xe2\x80\x99s current cultural divides: between rural and urban, parents and children, those moving ahead and those staying behind. \xe2\x80\x9cLeft your hometown for somewhere new/Don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised now it\xe2\x80\x99s leaving you,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings. It\xe2\x80\x99s a eulogy to youth that zeroes in with precision, each detail more wrenching than the last: \xe2\x80\x9cfuneral for a family pup\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbattery dies on your monthly call\xe2\x80\x9d and, finally, \xe2\x80\x9cgave the fascists a thousand ticks.\xe2\x80\x9d But this song isn\xe2\x80\x99t a simple slam on the generalized \xe2\x80\x9csmall-town mentality,\xe2\x80\x9d considering Gareth essentially still lives in the same small English town he grew up in. Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fall of Home\xe2\x80\x9d comes off like a sympathetic plea from someone familiar with\xc2\xa0both sides, who disagrees with the nationalist impulse but can fathom its root. And in its understanding, there is a glimmer of hope."" b'A strange positivity can also be found on an ambling track called\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA Slow, Slow Death\xe2\x80\x9d that concludes with the lines: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a slow, slow death if you want it/Yeah, I want it.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead of glorifying death or poking fun at it, though, this is a statement of stubborn resilience, of life. Especially in the streamed today/trashed tomorrow world of modern music, the possibility of a slow death can seem revolutionary. Los Campesinos! will never be the biggest, the best-looking, the most loved. But when their time comes, they will be able to look back, content.'"
b'Pissed Jeans',7.9,b'Why Love Now',0,b'Rock',b'March 1 2017',"b'Co-produced with\xc2\xa0Lydia Lunch, the new Pissed Jeans LP is the sludge-punk band\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0cleanest, most hi-fidelity album, and their deepest dive into the inglorious male psyche yet.'","b'Sometimes the best thing you can do as a male feminist is shut up and listen to women who know what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about better than you. That advice might hold doubly true for male musicians. For every \xe2\x80\x9cSuggestion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and, really, there\xe2\x80\x99s only been one \xe2\x80\x9cSuggestion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94there are countless self-identified good guys looking for an easy pat on the back simply for having their heart in the right place. There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why feminist punk spun off into a kind of genre unto itself: This is not subject matter that men usually do well.' b'Between their territorial growls and bludgeoning\xc2\xa0guitars, Pennsylvania sludge-punks Pissed Jeans have\xc2\xa0made a brand out of unfiltered male aggression;\xc2\xa0each of their\xc2\xa0four albums has played like an American Splendor comic reenacted by grizzly bears. Yet more so than frontmen who profess to be infinitely more political, Matt Korvette understands what he can contribute to the conversation about gender relations. His songs offer insight into the forces that drive men: the privileges, compulsions, indignities, entitlements, and double standards. He\xe2\x80\x99s touched on this territory often\xe2\x80\x94most notably on \xe2\x80\x9cMale Gaze,\xe2\x80\x9d his rubbernecking apology from 2013\xe2\x80\x99s terrific Honeys\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s never run with the muse as righteously as he does on Why Love Now, the band\xe2\x80\x99s deepest dive yet into the inglorious male psyche.' b'The record could almost pass for a concept album, if not for all of Korvette\xe2\x80\x99s usual digressions. He balances out his social insights with asides about sugary snacks, laugh-tracked sitcoms, astrology, and the like, and those flashes of irreverence are more welcome than ever, since the core of the album couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more pointed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bar Is Low\xe2\x80\x9d challenges the way society coddles men, rewarding them for the most modest demonstrations of decency, as if simply not being a violent monster entitles them to a medal. \xe2\x80\x9cHeld down a job/Even snagged a raise,\xe2\x80\x9d Korvette sings, \xe2\x80\x9cRight there you\xe2\x80\x99re due/For effusive praise.\xe2\x80\x9d On \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Your Knees,\xe2\x80\x9d he demonstrates how men neg women, picking at their insecurities to cut down their esteem.' b""And since it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a Pissed Jeans album without a healthy dose of sex and shame, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of that, too. \xe2\x80\x9cCold Whip Cream\xe2\x80\x9d introduces a frustrated guy too embarrassed to ask his partner to indulge his kink. On \xe2\x80\x9cIgnorecam,\xe2\x80\x9d Korvette goes off over a Mot\xc3\xb6rhead-worthy riff about the absurdity of men paying cam girls to essentially ignore them: \xe2\x80\x9cSo you're sick of interacting with women, you wanna pay for something that's free?/Shut yourself up and load the ignorecam, getting off on letting her be.\xe2\x80\x9d The track ends in angry, carnal release, with Korvette so overcome with self-hating ecstasy he loses track of his spelling. \xe2\x80\x9cN-O-R-G-I-E me!\xe2\x80\x9d he chants orgasmically, \xe2\x80\x9cO-G-I-N-R-E me!\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s grotesque, funny, and unsettling\xe2\x80\x94the Pissed Jeans sweet spot, basically."" b'As deft as Korvette is at describing what the patriarchy looks like from a man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, Why Love Now\xe2\x80\x99s sharpest insights come from outside himself\xe2\x80\x94by actually bringing in a woman. Author Lindsay Hunter penned and performs \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Man,\xe2\x80\x9d a mid-album monologue about life as the office alpha male. Adopting her best Danny McBride voice, she assails a coworker with come-ons and double entendres: \xe2\x80\x9cYou take dic-tations?/You get it?/You ever been stapled?/\xe2\x80\xa6 You cold?/Put on that cardigan you got hanging over your chair/Do it slow.\xe2\x80\x9d Behind her committed comic performance, there\xe2\x80\x99s a threat of real violence.' b'On a less loaded song cycle, Why Love Now\xe2\x80\x99s relative tunefulness would be the narrative. No wave pioneer Lydia Lunch produced the album along with black metal practitioner Arthur Rizk, and while that seems like it should be a recipe for discord, the pairing somehow resulted in the cleanest, most high-fidelity Pissed Jeans record yet. None of the bands\xe2\x80\x99 primary influences ever made an album this approachable\xe2\x80\x94not Melvins, not the\xc2\xa0Jesus Lizard, certainly not Pigfuck. The glistening post-punk riff on \xe2\x80\x9cLove Without Emotion\xe2\x80\x9d could have come from any number of friendly, telegenic British buzz bands; it\xe2\x80\x99d be virtually unidentifiable as a Pissed Jeans track if not for Korvette\xe2\x80\x99s phlegmy ogre routine. The band was wise to offer more carrot than stick for this one, though. Their music has never gone down easier, but their commentary has never hit so uncomfortably hard.'"
b'Xiu Xiu',6.4,b'FORGET',0,b'Experimental',b'March 1 2017',"b'The new Xiu Xiu LP\xc2\xa0consolidates several of the band\xe2\x80\x99s strengths\xe2\x80\x94mixing\xc2\xa0hooks, cacophony, and\xc2\xa0stellar\xc2\xa0production. Individual moments shine, but the album can lull you into a state of absentmindedness.'","b'Xiu Xiu has always been a polarizing act, though some observations about the band are commonly accepted. Jamie Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s tremulous vocals can feel vulnerable and threatening at once. He\xc2\xa0likes\xc2\xa0concept albums. And he is a fan of lots of kinds of music\xe2\x80\x94gamelan, noise, dance, folk, punk\xe2\x80\x94which makes\xc2\xa0his arrangements wondrously varied. Xiu Xiu has managed the feat of combining hooks and cacophony without spoiling either ingredient. They can offer a good time under the art-rock tent.' b'They can also be exasperating. As a lyricist, Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s penchant for disturbing themes has become predictable over the last 16 years. No matter how far afield Xiu Xiu travels sonically, the emotional landscape is fixed. That trend continues on their latest album\xe2\x80\x99s opener, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Call.\xe2\x80\x9d The song starts\xc2\xa0with rapid-fire, nearly rapped lines about a \xe2\x80\x9cbitch,\xe2\x80\x9d and closes with a coda that goes: \xe2\x80\x9cClap bitches/Why why why bitch/Why why cunt why/...Clap bitches.\xe2\x80\x9d At a level of vocal texture, these lines don\xe2\x80\x99t sound like they\xe2\x80\x99re sung by Stewart. (Credits list Enyce Smith as a guest vocalist on the track.) But in conceptual terms, the words definitely sound like they come from the guy who once sang \xe2\x80\x9cI Luv Abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d The\xc2\xa0verses and choruses shed little contextual light, and the final effect of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Call\xe2\x80\x9d is one of disorientation\xe2\x80\x94a familiar Xiu Xiu tactic.' b'By now, a choice like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem all that risky, or even commendably ugly. When he crafts a line like this, is Stewart just ticking boxes on the Xiu Xiu style-bingo sheet? Only he knows for sure. But both the pleasures and discomforts of FORGET\xc2\xa0involve the way the album invites\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0question. The set consolidates several\xc2\xa0of the band\xe2\x80\x99s strengths: The production is stellar, with plenty of room for noise-damage as well as melodies (which are numerous). Xiu Xiu has fielded a wide array of intriguing experimental records in the last couple years, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t turned in pop-adjacent songs this memorable since 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Always.' b'On \xe2\x80\x9cWondering,\xe2\x80\x9d group backing vocals and distortion squall create a chorus of wild power. The otherwise self-pitying \xe2\x80\x9cGet Up\xe2\x80\x9d launches an ascending arpeggio at its conclusion, and\xc2\xa0it\xe2\x80\x99s catchy and startling. Even the songs that don\xe2\x80\x99t register as strongly have winning quirks\xe2\x80\x94as with the timorous breakdown that leads to a screaming climax on\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cJenny GoGo.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'But as a collection, FORGET\xc2\xa0doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cohere in the same way that their best recent projects have. Plays the Music of Twin Peaks\xc2\xa0allowed the band to show an interpretive wisdom regarding another artist\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic, while remaining identifiable as Xiu Xiu. A recent collaboration with the contemporary classical group Mantra Percussion showed that Stewart can compose long-form works just as well as some of his ambitious experimental peers, like Deerhoof\xe2\x80\x99s Greg Saunier. (Saunier appears on \xe2\x80\x9cPetite,\xe2\x80\x9d and also co-produced FORGET, alongside John Congleton and band-member Angela Seo.) Those albums had a point of view, and made sustained stylistic arguments. But according to Stewart, the organizing conceit of FORGET\xc2\xa0has to do with the \xe2\x80\x9cduality of human frailty.\xe2\x80\x9d On the idea of forgetting, he says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a rebirth in blanked out renewal but it also drowns and mutilates our attempt to hold on to what is dear.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'That\xe2\x80\x99s all true enough (if a bit overwrought). But it\xe2\x80\x99s also thin: a simple observation about a human trait having benefits and drawbacks. Nor is there much evidence of this concept operating inside the record itself. Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s lines are filled with the expected references to \xe2\x80\x9cthe rape of everything decent\xe2\x80\x9d and the like\xe2\x80\x94but not much that\xe2\x80\x99s direct regarding the problems of a solipsism, or a selective memory.' b'The guests all seem a bit stranded, too. On the album finale, \xe2\x80\x9cFaith, Torn Apart,\xe2\x80\x9d the carillon tones of New York minimalist legend Charlemagne Palestine sound grafted onto the mix. And while a closing soliloquy voiced by legendary drag artist Vaginal Davis is arresting, it\xc2\xa0doesn\xe2\x80\x99t connect with anything that\xe2\x80\x99s come before. (In interviews, Stewart has detailed the inspiration behind what Davis says, but its presentation\xc2\xa0on the album remains vague.) Individual moments shine throughout FORGET: a stunning chorus here, a stirring lick of pitched percussion there. But the album\xe2\x80\x99s strangest attribute is the way it can lull you into a state of absentmindedness regarding those same charms.'"
b'Sun Kil Moon',6.5,b'Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood',0,b'Folk/Country',b'February 28 2017',"b""Songwriter Mark Kozelek's 130-minute epic is indeed daring and self-reflective, but\xc2\xa0too often he prides long stretches of bitter humor and anger over the subtlety of his previous work.""","b'In retrospect, Sun Kil Moon\xe2\x80\x99s 2014 milestone Benji was less of a breakthrough than a breakdown just before Mark Kozelek\xc2\xa0became definitively mean and\xc2\xa0petty. Even with Benji\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0life-flashing-before-your-eyes earnestness (the repentance! the forgiveness! the laughs! the tears!), its lessons seem to have gone unabsorbed. Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood\xc2\xa0comes in at 130 minutes. This is after two Sun Kil Moon albums\xe2\x80\x942015\xe2\x80\x99s Universal Themes, 2016\xe2\x80\x99s Jesu/Sun Kil Moon\xe2\x80\x94that left no one thinking, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish these were twice as long.\xe2\x80\x9d Kozelek knows that Common as Light isn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy sell.\xc2\xa0In a particularly forgettable number called \xe2\x80\x9cSeventies TV Show Theme Song,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits, \xe2\x80\x9cAll I know is this reminds me of the theme to \xe2\x80\x98Barney Miller\xe2\x80\x99/It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intentional, just adding a song on the record for filler.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not the only lyric on here that simply describes what the music sounds like, or dares you to stop listening. These are by-and-large the most confrontational songs Kozelek has ever put out, but strangely they\xe2\x80\x99re also some of the more exciting ones he\xe2\x80\x99s written since developing his post-Benji spoken word style.' b'While recent records have found Kozelek lambasting his vinyl-collecting fans and putting the fear of God in the minds of bloggers who miss his Red House Painters days, here Kozelek directs his fury more broadly. He makes three things absolutely clear: he hates iPhones, he hates Twitter, and he hates the twentysomethings who read Twitter on their iPhones. If there\xe2\x80\x99s a theme to this record (the way that, you know, acting in a Paolo Sorrentino film was the theme of the previous Sun Kil Moon LP), it\xe2\x80\x99s that the world is fucked, man, so get off your phone and respect your elders (especially Mark Kozelek). Many songs attempt to reflect Kozelek\xe2\x80\x99s anger following mass shootings to varying degrees of profundity. The awkwardly chipper music in \xe2\x80\x9cBastille Day\xe2\x80\x9d creates an effect not dissimilar to Smash Mouth playing the intro to \xe2\x80\x9cAll Star\xe2\x80\x9d on loop while their singer threatens the audience. This mode, as one might imagine, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up to a particularly moving collection of songs.' b'It does, however, make for some surprisingly great moments. In \xe2\x80\x9cPhiladelphia Cop,\xe2\x80\x9d which slowly evolves into a eulogy for David Bowie, Kozelek lands a bitter jab: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re a man in charge claiming you\xe2\x80\x99re a staunch feminist, then give a woman your job or shut the fuck up, Queen Bitch.\xe2\x80\x9d In the well-meaning \xe2\x80\x9cLone Star,\xe2\x80\x9d he helps save a suicidal woman\xe2\x80\x99s life and tries to convince North Carolina officials to amend their transphobic bathroom laws. The slow, ominous \xe2\x80\x9cSarah Lawrence College Song\xe2\x80\x9d finds him performing a small gig for a group of college students, which obviously leads to him berating them for how much their parents pay for tuition. He replies, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what Walmart pays me to use my music in commercials,\xe2\x80\x9d but quickly changes his tone: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I can go to their school one day too, \xe2\x80\x98cause they all seem like really nice people.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Many of these songs follow similar patterns: Kozelek snaps and sympathizes in the same breath. When he jokes with his colorblind building manager that he wants his tiles \xe2\x80\x9cgray\xe2\x80\xa6 like your hair, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he comments just a second later, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, I got a little gray too, I\xe2\x80\x99m not picking on you.\xe2\x80\x9d The reason why similarly quotidian story-songs like \xe2\x80\x9cGustavo\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cJim Wise\xe2\x80\x9d hit so hard was because they resulted in double portraits: You learned more about Kozelek through his observations of others. On Common as Light, Kozelek fills the whole frame, increasing the humor and anger, but sacrificing the subtlety. If the diaristic style he developed on his last few releases has been generously compared to novelists like Karl Ove Knausg\xc3\xa5rd or James Joyce, then these songs feel more like Larry David or, at their most vulgar, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Curiously, Kozelek plays a ton of synth here\xe2\x80\x94a foreign sound for any Sun Kil Moon record. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found that when you put an instrument in someone\xe2\x80\x99s hands that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t used to playing, interesting things happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he noticed in a recent interview. A lot of this does sound new, which is becoming more difficult as he becomes more prolific and the world catches up with him. Phil Elverum cited him as an influence for his upcoming Mount Eerie album, and you can hear pieces of \xe2\x80\x9cCarissa\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cRavens,\xe2\x80\x9d just like you can hear \xe2\x80\x9cSunshine in Chicago\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cOkkervil River R.I.P.,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI Watched the Film the Song Remains the Same\xe2\x80\x9d in Father John Misty\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLeaving L.A.\xe2\x80\x9d Kozelek\xe2\x80\x99s work continues to ripple outward, even as he retreats further and further into himself.' b'Just last year, a pitch-perfect parody made the rounds, mimicking Kozelek\xe2\x80\x99s style to the point of tricking a few people into thinking a new EP of his had surfaced. The irony is that those pensive, guitar-based songs already sound completely outdated\xe2\x80\x94representative of a different Mark Kozelek from a different time. Such is the nature of his work. Kozelek has always been his own most restless listener, and part of his motivation is simply to keep himself interested in making art, whether that means changing his band name, starting his own record label, or turning his own songwriting process into his muse. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear it and think, \xe2\x80\x98I prefer your older songs,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he sings in \xe2\x80\x9cSeventies TV Show Theme,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe the world has changed and I\xe2\x80\x99m not that songwriter anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d In spirit, Common as Light resembles his classic work more than he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to admit. After all, his previous epics Rollercoaster and April were emotionally exhausting listens, unfolding with the intensity of a man trying to pack everything he knows into one record. As disorienting and overwhelming as any of Kozelek\xe2\x80\x99s defining albums, Common as Light\xc2\xa0patiently reveals more of the artist to anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s still paying attention.'"
b'Stormzy',7.6,b'Gang Signs & Prayer',0,b'Rap',b'February 28 2017',"b'The debut solo album from the breakout grime MC is a detailed portrait and full-throated\xc2\xa0riot, switching between clapping back at lesser rappers and serving up smoothed-out Quiet Stormzy.'","b'Two years ago, Michael Omari stood on the stage at the 2015 Brit Awards, shoulder-to-shoulder with a who\xe2\x80\x99s who of UK rappers. Clad in all black, the MC known as Stormzy rocked along with Skepta, JME, Novelist, Jammer, Krept & Konan and dozens of others, flanking Kanye West as he performed his Paul McCartney collaboration \xe2\x80\x9cAll Day\xe2\x80\x9d amid a sea of white faces in tuxedos and cocktail dresses.' b'It was an important moment for British hip-hop and grime in particular. For years marginalized as too violent or \xe2\x80\x9cgang related\xe2\x80\x9d and mostly shut out from Britain\xe2\x80\x99s biggest pop music awards show, the heroes of the London underground had snuck in through a back door propped open by an American iconoclast. To say it had a profound effect on Stormzy\xe2\x80\x94and the entire underground scene\xe2\x80\x94would be an understatement.' b'It also marks the jumping-off point for Stormzy\xe2\x80\x99s bum rush on the pop charts. The overwhelming success of \xe2\x80\x9cShut Up\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the original video has now over\xc2\xa048 million views and the single bundled with \xe2\x80\x9cWicked Skengman 4\xe2\x80\x9d cracked the charts\xe2\x80\x94indicates a new paradigm in UK underground hip-hop. On radio shows and YouTube channels, in low-budget videos surrounded by the neighborhood squad, young MCs battle each other with pre-written \xe2\x80\x9cfreestyles\xe2\x80\x9d spit over well-known beats. And it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious why Stormzy has emerged from the scrum with a crown on his head: His booming voice and charisma are infectious and his 100-watt, silver-toothed smile lights up the screen.' b'Stormzy brings this battle rap mentality to Gang Signs & Prayer from the get-go. Opening track \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Things First\xe2\x80\x9d was intended \xe2\x80\x9cto be a punch in the face,\xe2\x80\x9d and the hyped-up grime rippers like \xe2\x80\x9cCold\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBig for Your Boots\xe2\x80\x9d are full of dire warnings to lesser rappers that might consider challenging his supremacy. But while he\xe2\x80\x99s made a name for himself battling, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s set his sights on something bigger: Stormzy fancies himself a crooner. He spends much of Gang Signs & Prayer going back and forth between clapping back at lesser rappers and serving up the \xe2\x80\x9cStiff Chocolate\xe2\x80\x9d of smoothed-out Quiet Stormzy.' b'He goes full-on gospel on \xe2\x80\x9cBlinded by Your Grace, Pt. 1,\xe2\x80\x9d forgoing a protective autotune armor for a gentle\xe2\x80\x94and pitchy\xe2\x80\x94prayer. He gives it another go on \xe2\x80\x9cVelvet,\xe2\x80\x9d which also features NAO, singing declarations of love to his \xe2\x80\x9cprincess.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s all painfully earnest, yet despite the cringes\xc2\xa0his croon inflicts, these moments feel essential to the ethos of Gang Signs & Prayer.' b'Both hard and soft, belligerent yet spiritual, Gang Signs & Prayer reveals a vulnerability belied by his 6-foot 5-inch frame and menacing glare. Even as he barks boasts on \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Things First,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits he\xe2\x80\x99s battled depression, and he follows up the horn blasts of \xe2\x80\x9cMr Skeng\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a scathing screed against doubters and dickheads\xe2\x80\x94with \xe2\x80\x9cCigarettes & Cush,\xe2\x80\x9d a tender recollection of a doomed relationship featuring Kehlani and Lily Allen. He presents these parts of himself unapologetically, juxtaposing the gang signs of his youth with the prayers from his Ghanian single mother, which quite literally grace \xe2\x80\x9c100 Bags\xe2\x80\x9d in a touching ode to her love and influence.' b'This dichotomy is fully realized on the album\xe2\x80\x99s final track, \xe2\x80\x9cLay Me Bare,\xe2\x80\x9d a syncopated confessional peppered with a chipmunk\xe2\x80\x99d vocal sample and mechanical trap hi-hat. He bleeds for five straight minutes, admitting his brief retreat from the spotlight in 2016 was a crisis of faith that left him depressed and isolated. He relives the pain of running into his absentee father, whose first words in years are to ask for a handout rather than forgiveness\xe2\x80\x94the one moment where his otherwise plaintive delivery is infused with rage. Even his catharsis is violent (\xe2\x80\x9cGrab this gun and aim it there/Shoot my pain and slay my fear\xe2\x80\x9d), taking a street-wise approach to conquering his demons.' b""Stormzy\xe2\x80\x99s biggest hits to date have all been testosterone-charged badman anthems, but he's also trying to reveal an artist with more than one dimension. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always work\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore the shortcomings of his singing voice, and the otherwise relatable lyrics on \xe2\x80\x9cCigarettes & Cush\xe2\x80\x9d are mired by a trite composition. But from the themes to the production choices to the sequencing, it\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkably well thought out debut from the ascendant 23-year-old MC."" b'Even more impressive, Stormzy\xe2\x80\x99s rapid rise to relevance comes independent of the major label/commercial radio industrial complex. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a major putting out a debut LP from a hardcore battle rapper with a song like the smoochy \xe2\x80\x9cVelvet,\xe2\x80\x9d but maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s the point\xe2\x80\x94he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need them. He\xe2\x80\x99s thus far made his\xc2\xa0living playing shows, releasing Spotify singles and low-budget YouTube videos, and hyping his favorite artists on his Beats 1 radio show, #Merky. And almost exactly two years after Kanye snuck him in the backdoor at the Brits, he strode into the 2017\xc2\xa0ceremony on the red carpet, glad-handing with Bradley Walsh and cheesing for the cameras in a crisp Burberry suit. And when Ed Sheeran brought him onstage to debut his verse on the \xe2\x80\x9cShape of You\xe2\x80\x9d remix, the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s fervent reaction proved he was anything but backup.'"
b'Entrance',7.4,b'Book of Changes',0,b'Rock',b'February 28 2017',"b'On his first Entrance LP\xc2\xa0in a decade, Guy Blakeslee\xe2\x80\x99s songs\xc2\xa0are\xc2\xa0newly exposed and intimate, telling a story\xc2\xa0of love and loss with folk, pop, and\xc2\xa0echoes of Laurel Canyon.'","b'Guy Blakeslee\xe2\x80\x99s career has drawn no straight stylistic lines.\xc2\xa0After breaking from the knotty psych rock of his Baltimore band the Convocation Of\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0in 2002, Blakeslee reemerged in the early \xe2\x80\x9900s with a series of warped records and a new identity: a haunted Delta blues conjurer called Entrance. In the years since, he staggered and sometimes stumbled through brooding stoner rock with the Entrance Band and, more recently, alternated phases of anemic indie and instrumental escapism under his given name. He has seemed, through it all, inquisitive and impressionable, responding in real time to sounds that piqued his interest as a listener first and a musician second. But\xc2\xa0Book of Changes, his first full album in a decade under the Entrance moniker, is\xc2\xa0one of the most inviting sets of songs he\xe2\x80\x99s ever made.' b'At its best, Book of Changes feels like a natural resting point for a songwriter who has spent the better part of two decades searching restlessly for the perfect sound. Somewhat surprisingly, it is a rather conventional distillation of folk, pop, and rock, dipping its toes into the echoes of Laurel Canyon and occasionally lifting its head to the narcotic heights of Roky Erickson or Love. There are traces of Phil Spector\xe2\x80\x99s trademark Wall of Sound, Lee Hazelwood and Nancy Sinatra\xe2\x80\x99s anxious romantic kismet, and the Zombies\xe2\x80\x99 subtle psychedelia, all wrapped around songs that share the windfalls and pratfalls of a year lost to love, presented in chronological order. \xe2\x80\x9cTime will pass if you laugh or if you cry,\xe2\x80\x9d Blakeslee sings in full vibrato during \xe2\x80\x9cThe Avenue,\xe2\x80\x9d the album\xe2\x80\x99s pop-symphonic centerpiece of emotional uncertainty. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the best of friends have to part sometimes/So why not you and I?\xe2\x80\x9d Turns out, Blakeslee traveled a long way just to ask old questions in unexpectedly simple ways.' b'Book of Changes is quite the production, though. It was recorded over a year and in nearly a dozen different studios on two continents with the help of some high-profile friends. There\xe2\x80\x99s Pixie Paz Lenchantin and producer and engineer David Vandervelde\xe2\x80\x94who cut a series of sterling albums a decade ago that align with Blakeslee\xe2\x80\x99s ramshackle, anthemic aims\xc2\xa0here. There are passels of drummers, backup singers, and string players.' b'But Blakeslee is clearly in control, playing as many as a half-dozen instruments on some songs. That\xe2\x80\x99s him with the perfectly pealing xylophone-and-piano lines during \xe2\x80\x9cAlways the Right Time\xe2\x80\x9d and the mystic autoharp during the exasperated \xe2\x80\x9cLeaving California.\xe2\x80\x9d More importantly, he foregrounds his own love-and-loss story, dividing it into 10\xc2\xa0acts of wide-eyed enthusiasm, waiting-by-the-phone unease, severe depression, and hopeful perseverance. He shares those feelings most effectively when the songs become a sort of pop music pulpit, a place for him to relay his story in open, verse-chorus-verse splendor. That happens during \xe2\x80\x9cAlways the Right Time,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWinter Lady,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRevolution Eyes,\xe2\x80\x9d the three songs that do the emotional heavy lifting and share the saturated sounds of Spector\xe2\x80\x99s successes. \xe2\x80\x9cRevolution Eyes\xe2\x80\x9d even borders on heartland rock, like John Mellencamp forced into the studio with the War on Drugs. It is direct and disarmed in a way that Blakeslee\xe2\x80\x99s music has rarely been.' b'Book of Changes is a good record built with occasionally great songs, especially that suite\xc2\xa0of Spector-like pop, but it ends with the same vexing questions about Blakeslee that have marked his entire career: Who is he? And will his output ever be more than a series of sometimes-marvelous conjurings, where he channels\xc2\xa0the ghosts of his influences (whether they be Neu! or Harry Nilsson) for an album or two? After all, even on\xc2\xa0this set, he slips into bolero camouflage (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d Be a Fool\xe2\x80\x9d), ambient musings (\xe2\x80\x9cWarm and Wild\xe2\x80\x9d), and western cover (\xe2\x80\x9cMolly\xe2\x80\x9d). At least these guises now feel like part of something bigger. Book of Changes is refreshingly exposed and intimate, as if Blakeslee has found a lingua franca for writing when it really matters. Perhaps Book of Changes is the start of Entrance in earnest, the beginning of a career that feels like more than a string of confidently executed echoes.'"
b'Six Organs of Admittance',8.1,b'Burning the Threshold',0,b'Experimental',b'February 28 2017',"b'This new LP from psych-folk guitar hero Ben Chasny is his\xc2\xa0warmest, most accessible release\xc2\xa0yet. Its supporting cast of avant-rock all-stars includes Damon & Naomi, Ryley Walker, and Circuit Des Yeux.'","b'For nearly 20 years now, Ben Chasny has been releasing a steady stream of records as Six Organs of Admittance, playing with other bands (Comets on Fire, Rangda) and participating in countless one-off collaborations. But 2015 found the psych-folk guitar hero embarking on a different kind of touring. The two Six Organs album he issued that year\xe2\x80\x94Hexadic\xc2\xa0and Hexadic II\xe2\x80\x94weren\xe2\x80\x99t just complementary electric/acoustic riffs on the same material. They were also veritable display models for a new, open-source model of composition that Chasny had developed, through specially notated and arranged playing cards. Explaining the concept\xe2\x80\x94known as the Hexadic system\xe2\x80\x94required Chasny to write an accompanying book, issue his own line of cards, draft up diagrams, and maintain an extensive section of related resources on his website. And for added clarity, he even hosted a series of lectures on the subject.' b'But as much as the Hexadic project seemed to announce a new phase in Chasny\xe2\x80\x99s career, its sheer scope and complexity has, for now at least, had the opposite effect\xe2\x80\x94that is, it\xe2\x80\x99s prompted Chasny to pursue simpler pleasures in his music. With Burning the Threshold, he reverts to the acoustic idyll last heard on 2011\xe2\x80\x99s Asleep on the Floodplain**.\xc2\xa0However, where that melodically-focused record could drift off into\xc2\xa0oscillating 12-minute odysseys, the new album puts a premium on clarity and concision. Quite simply, this is the warmest, most welcoming, and accessible album in Six Organs\xe2\x80\x99 canon\xe2\x80\x94which may come as a disappointment to fans who prefer Chasny\xe2\x80\x99s more extreme excursions. But for those who first encountered Chasny alongside Devendra Banhart and Joanna Newsom in 2004-era New Weird America magazine features, and\xc2\xa0haven\xe2\x80\x99t kept up with his prolific pace, this is the perfect place to rediscover his mesmerizing musicianship and sublime\xc2\xa0songcraft.' b'Chasny wrote Burning the Threshold while\xc2\xa0working on a musical based on the life of Wallace Stevens, and the though the two projects aren\xe2\x80\x99t directly related, the poet\xe2\x80\x99s magic realist approach shaped the album\xe2\x80\x99s thematic framework. Like his participatory approach to promoting Hexadic, Chasny has a way of translating weighty, obtuse ideas from science and theology into pure, easily relatable messaging. On \xe2\x80\x9cThings As They Are,\xe2\x80\x9d Chasny invokes Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 necessary-angel archetype to meditate on the relationship between natural wonder and human progress.\xc2\xa0On \xe2\x80\x9cAdoration Song,\xe2\x80\x9d he becomes possibly the first indie rock artist to namedrop French philosopher Gaston Bachelard in song when he intones, \xe2\x80\x9cour friend Gaston says we\xe2\x80\x99re made of lines,\xe2\x80\x9d before channeling that sentiment into a jubilant chorus. Over vigorous open-chord strums, he exhorts, \xe2\x80\x9cRise up now!/So Sun softly speaks/Adoration comes from our softened beaks,\xe2\x80\x9d transforming the song into an oblique protest anthem at a time when the very concept of compassion feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s under attack by the powers that be.' b'Though it ranks among Chasny\xe2\x80\x99s most gentle records, Burning the Threshold nonetheless accommodates a large supporting cast of avant-rock all stars who lend these intimately scaled songs a greater dimension. The gorgeous \xe2\x80\x9cUnder Fixed Stars\xe2\x80\x9d takes the hushed intro to the Rolling Stones\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cMoonlight Mile\xe2\x80\x9d and spins it out into a mantra, with Damon & Naomi\xe2\x80\x99s hypnotic hums swaddling some of Chasny\xe2\x80\x99s most tender lyrics to date (\xe2\x80\x9cI kept your letters inside my sleeve/Between my heart and my hand they breathe\xe2\x80\x9d). The instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cAround the Axis,\xe2\x80\x9d by contrast, sees Chasny squaring off against finger-picking phenom Ryley Walker in a left channel/right channel duel, their tense, tangled interplay blurring the line between harmony and discord. And in the album\xe2\x80\x99s lone act of aggression, \xe2\x80\x9cTaken by Ascent,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Chasny busts out his electric to shred overtop a taut, Chris Corsano-powered groove, with haunting guest vocals from Haley Fohr (a.k.a. Circuit Des Yeux) intensifying the song\xe2\x80\x99s ominous thrust.' b'But that proves to be a fleeting black-could intrusion on an album that otherwise brims with sunrise-summoning optimism, where every glistening guitar pluck seems to shake off the morning dew. Beyond the Threshold hits its rapturous peak on \xe2\x80\x9cSt. Eustace,\xe2\x80\x9d which resembles a Zeppelin III\xc2\xa0folk jam given a kosmische spin courtesy of Cooper Crain\xe2\x80\x99s splendorous synth drones. The song is named for the second-century Roman warrior who gave himself over to Christianity after seeing a vision of a crucifix hovering between the antlers of the deer he was hunting. Likewise, Beyond the Threshold is a means to coax ecstatic experiences from everyday occurrences\xe2\x80\x94whether through communion with God or just a bottle of Jager.'"

A few years ago, a captive festival goer might have been a producer's target audience; now the casual radio listener is the true prize. It's the difference between Skrillex, one of electronic music's most prominent artists, making \xe2\x80\x9cBangarang,\xe2\x80\x9d a 2x-platinum-certified single from 2012 that didn't register with the average commuter, and forging \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Are \xc3\x9c Now?\xe2\x80\x9d a Justin Bieber number that\xc2\xa0guaranteed a primo spot in the great hall of pop."" b""The Australian producer Flume (born Harley Edward Streten), built his career on a different type of accessibility. His songs can be easy to fall into, but they don't usually lasso listeners and ensnare them like an undeniable airwave triumph. Flume's 2012 self-titled debut, an oasis of lite house and loungeable hip-hop, offered refuge from the fusillade of trap beats sweeping through electronic music at the time. His second full-length, Skin, released four years later, set aside big-room lullabies to emphasize big-name collaborations, but there was a reticent quality to it. Flume worked with rappers on the declarative, bruising end of the spectrum\xe2\x80\x94Vic Mensa, Vince Staples\xe2\x80\x94but didn't make the kind of songs that really knocked you on your ass. He enlisted singers\xe2\x80\x94Beck, Tove Lo\xe2\x80\x94to create pop songs that were neither sugary nor off-kilter. He spoke of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cmak[ing] experimental music accessible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfus[sing] the abrasive and the beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d but seemed to sell both sides short."" b""Flume patrols the same liminal zone on Skin Companion EP II. He leads with an uppercut, a track that's supposed to slug its way into your subconscious: \xe2\x80\x9cEnough\xe2\x80\x9d features rapping from the stolid veteran Pusha T, and the beat shovels a stream of noises\xe2\x80\x94hollow wood tones, staticky crumbles\xe2\x80\x94at the listener to stimulate a fight-or-flight response. But the song plays as an attempt to redo Lil Uzi Vert's \xe2\x80\x9cUzi\xe2\x80\x9d and extract the magic from its alluring rumble. The central riffs of the two tracks are similar, as are the liquidating blots of bass and the drum breaks that \xe2\x80\x9cUzi\xe2\x80\x9d-producer Charlie Heat also inserted into Kanye West's \xe2\x80\x9cAll Day.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEnough\xe2\x80\x9d never surges beyond emulation, any abrasiveness blunted by the feeling that this is an academic beat-making exercise."" b""The rest of Skin Companion II veers away from the rough stuff to return to the modes Flume explored on his first album. \xe2\x80\x9cDepth Charge\xe2\x80\x9d will do fine as a bridge towards the more peaceful side of a live set. \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d a collaboration with Dave Bayley of Glass Animals, is a colorless mid-tempo number with a clomping drum pattern designed to make heads bob. The most promising tune on the EP is \xe2\x80\x9cWeekend,\xe2\x80\x9d a reverie with extended beat-less portions. Though Moses Sumney's presence only registers as the song begins to wind down, his soothing tone is enough to summon the floating, comatose feeling. Flume\xc2\xa0doesn't want to be pinned down, and he's intent on proving his ability to make functional music for multiple scenarios. But malleability is only really powerful when it's accompanied by memorability, and the latter remains out of reach for Flume."""
b'Thundercat',8.5,b'Drunk',1,b'Jazz',b'February 27 2017',"b""The third album from bassist/songwriter Thundercat is whimsical and somber, funny and meaningful, sometimes all at once.\xc2\xa0Drunk's oddball soul confronts\xc2\xa0the challenge of just trying to live life.""","b'Thundercat gives himself a pep talk at the beginning of Drunk: \xe2\x80\x9cComb your beard, brush your teeth \xe2\x80\xa6 beat your meat, go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d At least he\xe2\x80\x99s in marginally better spirits these days. Following the death of his friend and collaborator Austin Peralta, his last two releases\xe2\x80\x942013\xe2\x80\x99s Apocalypse and 2015\xe2\x80\x99s The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam*\xe2\x80\x94*explored the concept of extinction and what the spirit might endure when the body expires. On these records\xe2\x80\x94along with Flying Lotus\xe2\x80\x99 2014 album You\xe2\x80\x99re Dead!, where Thundercat contributed bass or vocals to many of its songs\xe2\x80\x94the singer and preeminent bassist (born Stephen Bruner) tried to make sense of a devastating truth. Peralta was gone, and one day, he will be gone too.' b'All this cosmic morbidity leaned on Thundercat\xe2\x80\x99s music, which takes on many forms all at once: \xe2\x80\x9970s funk, R&B, punk with tinges of fusion. His art is undeniably black, yet the structures are loose enough to pull in all sorts of listeners. It speaks to those who love soul and ska equally, those who spazz just the same when George Duke or Bad Brains flash across the iPod. Thundercat is equal parts Nintendo generation, \xe2\x80\x9960s flower child, and hardcore skater bro. His live show is punk as hell; serene studio tracks are given loud, frenetic makeovers. On top of all that rests Thundercat\xe2\x80\x99s smooth falsetto, a transcendent voice that can usher you into some sort of demise (\xe2\x80\x9cDescent Into Madness\xe2\x80\x9d), sing lovingly to his pet cat (\xe2\x80\x9cTron Song\xe2\x80\x9d), or make drugs seem perfectly fine (\xe2\x80\x9cDMT Song,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOh Sheit It\xe2\x80\x99s X.\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'If Thundercat\xe2\x80\x99s recent work focused on the uncertainty of death, Drunk confronts the challenge of just trying to live life. It\xe2\x80\x99s a marathon through the mind of Bruner that uses his casually humorous and honest songwriting to detail that which is cool and that which sucks. Cool? Kenny Loggins and Dragon Ball Z wrist-slap bracelets. Sucks? Friend zones and the police state. Featuring Kendrick Lamar (\xe2\x80\x9cWalk on By\xe2\x80\x9d), Wiz Khalifa (\xe2\x80\x9cDrink Dat\xe2\x80\x9d) and Kamasi Washington (\xe2\x80\x9cThem Changes\xe2\x80\x9d) among others, Drunk plays like an anxious stoner album, the aural equivalent of late-night channel surfing. Its 23 tracks present a fluid narrative that begins on a somewhat bright note and gradually fades into darkness\xe2\x80\x94a concept record that takes you through a bleary night of drinking, drugs, funk, and heartbreak with Thundercat himself.' b""He\xc2\xa0is whimsical and somber, funny and meaningful, sometimes all at once. Each song hovers around the two-minute mark, defying those \xe2\x80\x9870s fusion forebears whose tracks could drag on over dense harmonies and time signatures. Drunk hits all the melodic and emotional themes Thundercat aims for without belaboring the point. On openers \xe2\x80\x9cRabbot Ho\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Stupido,\xe2\x80\x9d he comes off a bit goofy and red-eyed, leaving his wallet at the club after a night of partying. \xe2\x80\x9cBus in These Streets,\xe2\x80\x9d which resembles the theme of 1980s children show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Space Coaster,\xe2\x80\x9d uses a sarcastic nursery rhyme flow to chide our collective social media dependence (\xe2\x80\x9cThank God for technology \xe2\x80\x98cause where would we be if we couldn't tweet our thoughts,\xe2\x80\x9d Thundercat quips). \xe2\x80\x9cJameel\xe2\x80\x99s Space Ride,\xe2\x80\x9d a transitional song near the album\xe2\x80\x99s end, uses a chiptune-inspired beat while he sings of the struggle between minorities and law enforcement: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m safe on my block, except for the cops/Will they attack, would it be \xe2\x80\x98cause I\xe2\x80\x99m black?\xe2\x80\x9d This, of course, is after he literally meows about how cool it must be to be a cat."" b""All this oddball soul feels more anchored to Thundercat's humanity than his previous releases. We see him here as both a heartbroken insomniac, someone who looks at the world alongside Pharrell on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Turn Down\xe2\x80\x9d and wonders if \xe2\x80\x9ceverything we do is weak,\xe2\x80\x9d and a juvenile jazzbo who wants to \xe2\x80\x9cblow all [his] cash on anime.\xe2\x80\x9d Much like The Golden Age of Apocalypse*\xc2\xa0*and Apocalypse, which leapfrogged several different genres with dizzying results, he\xe2\x80\x99s able to keep it all together, offering a puzzling ride that feels coherent despite its moving parts. Unlike his past work, which put his musicianship on great display, Drunk presents the defining picture of Thundercat as a person: quirky, political, thoughtful, weird\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes drunk. These descriptors aren\xe2\x80\x99t surprising if you follow him on Twitter, but here, Thundercat comes off like the guy who you can hit up at the bar and riff on pretty much anything. Given all he\xe2\x80\x99s gone through personally, it\xe2\x80\x99s an honor to hear Thundercat feeling like himself again."""
b'The Feelies',8.0,b'In Between',0,b'Rock',b'February 27 2017',"b'The new Feelies album is\xc2\xa0both mellow and intense in ways only the New Jersey band can pull off. With the increased use\xc2\xa0of acoustic guitar, it feels like a spiritual sequel to 1986\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0The Good Earth.'","b'In 2011, when the Feelies released their first album in 20 years, it came with hints of indecision. It was called *Here Before\xe2\x80\x94*possibly as in \xe2\x80\x9cbeen there, done that\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and began with the lyric \xe2\x80\x9cIs it too late to do it again?/Or should we wait another 10?\xe2\x80\x9d The music certainly sounded confident, in the breezy but determined style that the New Jersey quintet patented around the time of their second album, 1986\xe2\x80\x99s The Good Earth. But you could forgive diehards for wanting clearer signs that the Feelies were back to stay.' b'With\xc2\xa0this new Feelies album, there remains no explicitly outlined future for the band. But the record\xc2\xa0is called\xc2\xa0In Between\xe2\x80\x94presumably there\xe2\x80\x99s more to come\xe2\x80\x94and it offers hope in titles such as \xe2\x80\x9cStay the Course\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTime Will Tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and\xc2\xa0in lines like,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTake your time, not going anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d Beyond these small\xc2\xa0signs, there are increased levels of musical commitment and design. The record is\xc2\xa0more purposefully-sequenced than its predecessor, with tracks that build on each other through subtle motifs. In press materials, guitarist and singer Glenn Mercer describes the record as \xe2\x80\x9claid back,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\xe2\x80\x99s right. But it\xe2\x80\x99s as precise and efficient as it is casual and comfortable.' b'In its best moments, In Between sounds both mellow and intense in ways only the Feelies can pull off. That\xe2\x80\x99s helped along by\xc2\xa0the increased prominence of acoustic guitar compared to Here Before (making the album a kind of spiritual sequel to The Good Earth). Acoustic guitars naturally exude calm, but Mercer and Bill Million imbue them with a sharpness. The quick strums in the pithy \xe2\x80\x9cTurn Back Time\xe2\x80\x9d and aforementioned swayer \xe2\x80\x9cStay the Course\xe2\x80\x9d both soothe and energize. Acoustics even tighten the otherwise placid ballad \xe2\x80\x9cMake It Clear.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Still, the Feelies remain a democratic machine, with each sound snugly complementing the other. They\xe2\x80\x99re masters at weaving their moving parts into a kinetic whole: Take \xe2\x80\x9cGone Gone Gone,\xe2\x80\x9d an insta-classic that\xc2\xa0escalates simple\xc2\xa0chords into a cycle of tension\xc2\xa0and release. While Mercer intones open-ended lyrics (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to know?/What do you want to do?\xe2\x80\x9d), the tune\xc2\xa0peaks when bassist Brenda Sauter redirects the band\xe2\x80\x99s momentum like a ship\xe2\x80\x99s rudder.' b'All the instrumental symbiosis on In Between connects its songs\xc2\xa0into an arc. That\xe2\x80\x99s emphasized by how the album\xc2\xa0begins and ends. On previous records, the Feelies liked to conclude\xc2\xa0with a cover: the Velvet Underground\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Goes On\xe2\x80\x9d on 1988\xe2\x80\x99s Only Life, the Stooges\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cReal Cool Time\xe2\x80\x9d on 1991\xe2\x80\x99s Time for a\xc2\xa0Witness. Here, they cover themselves, reprising the sparse opening title track as a long, dense closing\xc2\xa0jam. Explicitly framing the album as a cycle is a typically\xc2\xa0Zen move, suggesting that this evergreen\xc2\xa0band\xc2\xa0plans on more trips around the sun.'"
b'Jonwayne',7.6,b'Rap Album Two',0,b'Rap',b'February 27 2017',"b'Finally full of purpose, rapper Jonwayne navigates his own downward spiral, seeking the answer to his most important question: What do you do when rap is both your living and a fuel for your vices?'","b'In 2014, Los Angeles rapper/producer Jonwayne had a crisis of faith. His suddenly-realized rap dreams were the impetus for his own implosion. A battle with alcoholism\xc2\xa0waged in part because of a crippling fear of flying, and the harshness of his lifestyle threatened to ruin him. He canceled his shows, parted ways with his label Stones Throw, and retreated from the rap scene. The next year, he released an EP called Jonwayne is Retired. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m grieving I stay up writing these masterpieces,\xe2\x80\x9d he rapped. His second full-length rap album seems to prove that assertion. It\xe2\x80\x99s an introspective journal that uses self-critique as a lens through which to examine the fragility of rap celebrity on any scale. It considers what it means to be a rapper and it considers the cost. Rap Album Two deconstructs Jonwayne to build him back up.' b""Jonwayne has always been a master craftsman and talented technician, but in the past, his raps didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have any function. It was rapping for the sake of it. He had plenty of knotty, syllable-twisting wordplay pivoting on slant rhymes and internal schemes, but much of the content was filler. His full-length debut as a lyricist, Rap Album One, was bogged down by his inability to get out of his own head, rattling off series after series of pointless puzzlers and long-winded (albeit fun) workarounds for rap cliches aiming to show how clever he was. Instilled with purpose, Rap Album Two weighs every sentence carefully. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in constructing complex lyrical miracle word exhibitions. He's too busy wondering if rap is even worth it."" b""Much of Rap Album Two is about rap as both an instrument of destruction and a vehicle for redemption. It finds Jonwayne navigating his own downward spiral, seeking the answer to his most important question: What do you do when rap is both your living and a fuel for your vices? His writing, which was once so heady, is now sobering. He\xe2\x80\x99s rapping more deliberately, and the bars all mean more, carrying bigger burdens but bringing bigger rewards. There\xe2\x80\x99s literally a song called \xe2\x80\x9cThese Words Are Everything.\xe2\x80\x9d Songs like the existentialist daydream \xe2\x80\x9cHuman Condition\xe2\x80\x9d and the punching \xe2\x80\x9cCity Lights\xe2\x80\x9d explore the consequences of addiction, especially when pursuing a rap career (\xe2\x80\x9cThere's a price to it youngin\xe2\x80\x99/You most likely don\xe2\x80\x99t invite the kind of vices we brung in/Be it poison of the body or the kind you can\xe2\x80\x99t see \xe2\x80\x98cause it's creeping up behind\xe2\x80\x9d). The album uses a beatpack with snappy, slow-rolling drums, minor piano chords, soul hymnals, and sunless tones to depict an ongoing recalibration, as Jonwayne finds his way back to rap."" b""On \xe2\x80\x9cLIVE from the Fuck You,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the album\xe2\x80\x99s keenest moments, a stranger approaches the rapper in public asking for an impromptu concert for a girl he\xe2\x80\x99s with (\xe2\x80\x9cShe says she knows who you are, I think she's a big fan\xe2\x80\x9d) before tagging on a dismissal: \xe2\x80\x9cShe says you rap and I\xe2\x80\x99m not really seeing it, dog.\xe2\x80\x9d Jonwayne finally indulges his request for on-the-spot raps with a verse dismantling the \xe2\x80\x9cfan\xe2\x80\x9d and his actions: \xe2\x80\x9cSo here\xe2\x80\x99s a little story bout the way I make it hurt/The way I make you learn how not to approach a man who\xe2\x80\x99s suffering for his work like a monkey in the circus.\xe2\x80\x9d The observations aren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly revelatory but they are cleverly articulated, and the sharpness with which they\xe2\x80\x99re delivered makes them potent. The most telling moment on Rap Album Two is \xe2\x80\x9cThe Single,\xe2\x80\x9d a chest-beating song he botches several times before scrapping. The title of the song and his inability to complete it best exemplify the album\xe2\x80\x99s primary lesson: the pursuit of stardom can be punishing, both on mind and body."" b'Rap Album Two is easily the most fulfilling project Jonwayne has ever made loaded with the most thoughtful writing of his career. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the gravity of subjects, it\xe2\x80\x99s the carefulness with which he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to examine them. Every candid, incredibly personal line contains some form of catharsis. Alcoholism drove him into isolation and loneliness only led to further self-sabotage. But this record is a triumph over that. These raps don\xe2\x80\x99t just exist for posterity; they, too, are a part of the healing process. As Jonwayne rethinks his \xe2\x80\x9corder of operations,\xe2\x80\x9d he becomes closer to whole.'"

It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say underappreciated bands were ahead of their time, but Six by Seven were totally of their time.'","b'Six by Seven were but one of many British bands to carry the \xe2\x80\x9cnext Radiohead\xe2\x80\x9d albatross in the late \xe2\x80\x9990s. Despite endorsements from tastemakers like Jools Holland and John Peel, their 1998 debut album, The Things We Make, didn\xe2\x80\x99t yield a \xe2\x80\x9cCreep\xe2\x80\x9d-sized crossover. It did boast a pretty great \xe2\x80\x9cStop Whispering\xe2\x80\x9d in the yearning \xe2\x80\x9cFor You,\xe2\x80\x9d but the rest of the record wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so eager to please, as it wrapped singer-guitarist Chris Olley\xe2\x80\x99s plaintive melodicism in slow-roiling surges that owed more to the stalking gaits of post-rock than Britpop. That tension between their congenial and contrarian instincts likely scuttled Six by Seven\xe2\x80\x99s chart potential, but on their follow-up album, the Nottingham band turned their frustrations and square-peg/round-hole relationship with popular culture into a badge of honor.' b'On the surface, the reappearance of The Closer You Get\xc2\xa0is an oddly timed archival project\xe2\x80\x94rather than wait until next year to mark the 20th-anniversary of their debut album, Six by Seven are jumping the queue to do a 17th-anniversary deluxe vinyl repackaging of their second (complete with a bonus collection of Peel sessions). Though Olley rebooted the Six by Seven name in 2013 after a half decade hiatus, next month, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be reforming with the band\xe2\x80\x99s original line-up to perform The Closer You Get in its entirety at a couple of shows in the UK\xe2\x80\x94a reunion spurred by group of fans who lobbied to make the album\xe2\x80\x99s lead-off track \xe2\x80\x9cEat Junk Become Junk\xe2\x80\x9d a party-crashing contender in the UK\xe2\x80\x99s annual Christmas No. 1 sweepstakes back in 2015. But that stunt campaign speaks to a genuine need\xe2\x80\x94The Closer You Get has resurfaced not out of knee-jerk nostalgia, but because it feels so vitally, viscerally now.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s common to say underappreciated bands were ahead of their time, but Six by Seven were totally of their time. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that, in that brief post-Blair, pre-9/11 golden age, most people didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear songs about unfettered consumerism, class conflict, media addiction, and social isolation. The Closer You Get resembles the kind of record Radiohead may have put out in 2000 had Thom Yorke chosen Mark E. Smith instead of Richard D. James as his spirit animal\xe2\x80\x94an album for people who like the idea of Muse, but can\xe2\x80\x99t stomach the pretension of the real one. Rather than attempt to make electronic music, Six by Seven filtered its\xc2\xa0influence through standard guitar-band instrumentation: the patient builds and trembling leads of their debut gave way to frenetic, skittering rhythms and tweaked-out distortion-pedal squalls, transforming the band from art-rock aesthetes to noise-punk preachers.' b'And in 17 years, Olley\xe2\x80\x99s targets have only become more firmly entrenched. The lacerating invectives of \xe2\x80\x9cEat Junk Become Junk\xe2\x80\x9d leave fresh wounds at a time when a trash-TV huckster has moved into the White House, and while \xe2\x80\x9cSawn Off Metallica T-Shirt\xe2\x80\x9d may deal in white-trash caricature, its dirtbag protagonist\xe2\x80\x99s delusions of grandeur (\xe2\x80\x9cLenny Bruce Lee Marvin Gaye\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve got style, and I\xe2\x80\x99m misunderstood!\xe2\x80\x9d) ring all too familiar in an era of toxic, #GHBTP-grade masculinity and #alternativefacts. (Though the two groups are aesthetic opposites, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if fellow Nottinghammers Sleaford Mods learned a few lessons in bile-spewing from this record.)' b'But as much as The Closer You Get unleashes Six by Seven\xe2\x80\x99s latent aggression, there\xe2\x80\x99s a part of Olley that\xe2\x80\x99s holding out hope to commune with the masses\xe2\x80\x94and for all its buckshot cultural critique, the album doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sacrifice Olley\xe2\x80\x99s flair for melancholy and impassioned appeals to the heart. The desperate sentiments of \xe2\x80\x9cNew Year\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cgive me something I can live for/Give me something to believe in\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94come couched in a psych-pop sway before a string-swept chorus shoots the song skyward, while the fuzzed-out mid-album double shot of \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t Wanna Stop\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSlab Square\xe2\x80\x9d burns like the sound of a band raging against the dying of the light.' b'By contrast, The Closer You Get\xe2\x80\x99s tent-pole ballads\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cEngland and a Broken Radio\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c100 and Something Foxhall Road\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are more like flickering, short-wicked candles that nonetheless illuminate a path out of the darkness. The former communicates its music-as-salvation message through mellow, Mogwai-esque atmospherics; the latter is both a love letter and farewell note\xe2\x80\x94to an old flame, to Nottingham, to the possibility of happiness itself. As Olley\xe2\x80\x99s more famous peers\xc2\xa0once wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get sentimental/It always ends up drivel.\xe2\x80\x9d But what makes The Closer You Get more than just a delirious dive through modern life\xe2\x80\x99s rubbish is Olley\xe2\x80\x99s desire to forge an emotional connection with those who feel weighed down by it. And if that means occasionally getting sentimental, then, for Olley, it\xe2\x80\x99s a risk worth taking.'"
b'Weezer',10.0,b'Weezer (Blue Album)',0,b'Rock',b'February 26 2017',"b'Weezer\xe2\x80\x99s 1994 debut, filled\xc2\xa0with geeky humor, dense cultural references, and positively gargantuan hooks, took alt-rock in a striking new direction.'","b'Weezer mastermind Rivers Cuomo\xc2\xa0was such a somber kid that\xc2\xa0his second-grade teacher trained the other students to tell him, in unison, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see the smile.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Childhood in Yogaville, the ashram and Integral Yoga HQ led by \xe2\x80\x9cWoodstock guru\xe2\x80\x9d Swami Satchidananda in eastern Connecticut, was isolating, devoid of much pop culture and adventure\xe2\x80\x94until Cuomo heard Kiss. When a family friend brought their fifth album, 1976\xe2\x80\x99s Rock and Roll Over, to the Cuomo house, it sent Rivers and younger brother Leaves launching off furniture in a way only formative music can. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve pretty much based my life around that record,\xe2\x80\x9d he has said. With their comic-book personas and distorted riffs, Kiss cracked Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s young brain wide open and rewired it for good. He had little idea what debauchery they were singing of, but from that point on, Cuomo began having intense dreams about becoming a rock star, and he began obsessively studying the work of his songwriting heroes.' b'For\xc2\xa0Rivers, music offered both a coat of armor and an identity. As a pre-teen enrolled in public school for the first time, Cuomo went by a different first name and his stepfather\xe2\x80\x99s last name (Kitts); his chosen moniker\xe2\x80\x94Peter Kitts\xe2\x80\x94was awfully close to that of Kiss drummer Peter Criss. And while Cuomo was still picked on as he made his way through puberty, he eventually found his people: the metalheads. In 1989, Cuomo moved from Connecticut with his high school band to Los Angeles, ground zero for the AquaNetted and Spandexed. There, he found himself in the midst of shifting tastes, both culturally and personally. He started working at the Sunset Boulevard Tower Records, where he was schooled on quintessentially \xe2\x80\x9ccool\xe2\x80\x9d music like the Velvet Underground, Pixies, and Sonic Youth.' b'Also in the mix\xc2\xa0at this time was a new band called Nirvana. When Cuomo first heard \xe2\x80\x9cSmells Like Teen Spirit\xe2\x80\x9d on the radio in late 1991 while washing dishes in an Italian restaurant, he was sorta pissed he didn\xe2\x80\x99t write it himself. \xe2\x80\x9cRivers says, \xe2\x80\x98I should have written that,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d remembered early Weezer guitarist Jason Cropper in John D. Luerssen\xe2\x80\x99s band biography,\xc2\xa0River\xe2\x80\x99s Edge. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x98Yeah. That\xe2\x80\x99s totally true.\xe2\x80\x99 Because the music he was writing was improving in quality every day.\xe2\x80\x9d Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Nirvana became an obsession. He\xe2\x80\x99d taken notes from\xc2\xa0Brian Wilson, the Beatles, Scorpions, Yngwie Malmsteen, and, of course, Kiss. But for all his knowledge of rock history, he still cared deeply about writing anthems that spoke to his generation, even if he had trouble looking his peers in the eyes.' b'Weezer\xc2\xa0anthems were destined to be different. In 1994, the acts dominating the modern rock charts were pushing against something, from the British aesthetes (Depeche Mode, New Order, Morrissey) to the singular weirdos (Beck, Tori Amos, Red Hot Chili Peppers) to the disenfranchised youth (Nirvana, Green Day, Pearl Jam). With rebellion came a facade of cool, and that was something Weezer could never manage, at least not in the traditional way. Cuomo\xc2\xa0always tried a little too hard. He would become the fidgety anti-frontman with a thousand \xe2\x80\x9crevenge of the nerds\xe2\x80\x9d taglines\xc2\xa0and a Harvard degree to prove it. That dichotomy\xe2\x80\x94the big-time rockstar in khakis and Buddy Holly glasses, who never seems totally comfortable in his own skin\xe2\x80\x94is what launched his cult and anchored his unlikely sex appeal. And his band\xe2\x80\x94drummer Patrick Wilson, bassist Matt Sharp, and guitarist Brian Bell\xe2\x80\x94played along, accentuating their innate geekiness to make Weezer feel like a unified front.' b'By the summer of 1993, Cuomo had written a number of songs strong enough to convince the alt-rock major DGC to sign Weezer (this despite a lack of buzz around the L.A. scene) and have the Cars\xe2\x80\x99 frontman Ric Ocasek produce their first album. When the group\xe2\x80\x99s self-titled debut\xe2\x80\x94typically known as The Blue Album\xe2\x80\x94arrived in May 1994, Cobain had been dead for a month. A feeling of dread hung over the alternative rock world whose prominence was ushered in by the Seattle sound. With their wired energy, effortless power-pop-punk hooks, and Beach Boys harmonies, Weezer took the alt-rock explosion in a new direction.\xc2\xa0You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite tell if Cuomo was mocking his song\xe2\x80\x99s regressive narrators or sympathizing with them. But once you got past his defense mechanisms and sorting through the humor and cultural references, you found a portrait of a young man\xe2\x80\x99s psyche, riddled with angst and insecurity. And it arrived on the wings of massive riffs and gnarled guitar solos that sounded like they were emanating from a Flying V\xe2\x80\x94on every single song.' b'The Blue Album\xe2\x80\x99s exploration of the fragile male ego is in full swing by the record\xe2\x80\x99s second track, \xe2\x80\x9cNo One Else.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Taken at face value, this is likely the most misogynistic song Weezer has ever released. \xe2\x80\x9cI want a girl who will laugh for no one else,\xe2\x80\x9d Cuomo sings while the band rushes through the fuzzy pop-punk changes, evoking the hyperbole of masculinity. But there\xe2\x80\x99s more beneath the surface. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No One Else\xe2\x80\x99 is about the jealous-obsessive asshole in me freaking out on my girlfriend,"" Cuomo has said. The song acquires even more resonance in the context of its sequencing on the record. Cuomo described the following song, \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Has Turned and Left Me Here,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0as \xe2\x80\x9cthe same asshole wondering why she\'s gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0In actuality, he\xc2\xa0spends most of \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Has Turned and Left Me Here\xe2\x80\x9d muttering to his ex\xe2\x80\x99s wallet photograph and masturbating to her memory, getting in a joke along the way, saying she enjoyed the sex \xe2\x80\x9cmore than ever.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s an absurd scene, but imagine the sentiment coming from the wrong person and it\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly not so funny. Weezer were masterful at walking this line between knowing jokiness and legitimately creepy dysfunction.' b'This base kind of arrested development shifts back and forth between the narrator\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with girls and his views on himself. If \xe2\x80\x9cNo One Else\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe World Has Turned and Left Me Here\xe2\x80\x9d are mirror twins, so are \xe2\x80\x9cSurf Wax America\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Garage.\xe2\x80\x9d Given that Weezer were named after a common term for asthma sufferers, no one expected them to be out on a board riding the waves. That tension animates \xe2\x80\x9cSurf Wax America,\xe2\x80\x9d a well-crafted jumble of harmonic puzzles and barreling punk guitars where the hedonistic surfer lifestyle is both celebrated and chided for its simplistic worldview. Even while the song sneers, the ferocity of Cuomo screaming \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go!\xe2\x80\x9d juxtaposed with the solemnness of the band\xe2\x80\x99s Wilsonian harmonies make you believe, once again, in Weezer\xe2\x80\x99s sincerity. Meanwhile, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Garage\xe2\x80\x9d is an homage to that happy place where no one judges you for your comic books, D&D figurines, and Kiss posters. It seems like over-the-top self-parody, but the garage was indeed a real place where early Weezer practiced and recorded when Cuomo, Sharp, and original guitarist Justin Fisher lived together in the \xe2\x80\x9cAmherst House\xe2\x80\x9d near Santa Monica. The hopeless ambition of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Garage\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0would make it the defining song of nerd-rock.' b'In between \xe2\x80\x9cSurf Wax America,\xe2\x80\x9d a fantasy about someone completely different, and \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Garage,\xe2\x80\x9d a hyper-detailed song about himself, lies a song about his father. There are two more nakedly emotional songs on Blue, which are set off further by Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s rare embrace of laid-back guitars. Atop a bluesy jangle, \xe2\x80\x9cSay It Ain\xe2\x80\x99t So\xe2\x80\x9d details the moment when Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s deepest worries\xc2\xa0are realized: He sees a beer in the fridge and, remembering how his father drank before he walked out, he senses his stepfather is doing the same. He fears now that he, too, is destined for this fate. Pinkerton, Weezer\xe2\x80\x99s sophomore album, is often described as the tortured confessional to end all tortured confessionals, essentially a diary of Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s notorious Asian fetish. But \xe2\x80\x9cSay It Ain\xe2\x80\x99t So\xe2\x80\x9d is just as raw, and arguably has more that its listeners can use, throwing its arms wide open to anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s known the trauma of dad issues. The music is constructed perfectly, building and building until what\'s left of Cuomo\'s vulnerability comes out as a bitterly frayed ""yeah-yeah,"" all capped by a guitar solo worthy of the\xc2\xa0Scorpions.' b'The desire to write a perfect song can drive some songwriters mad, as their belief in music as a vehicle for emotional expression reconciles itself with the belief that pop is a puzzle that can be solved. On Blue, Cuomo found the ideal balance, as he rarely has since. He understood the rules so well that he also knew when to break them, from Sharp\xe2\x80\x99s super silly new-wave keyboard in \xe2\x80\x9cBuddy Holly\xe2\x80\x9d to the mumbled dialogue that runs through \xe2\x80\x9cUndone\xe2\x80\x9d (the band and their friends chatting were a backup plan after DGC refused to clear dialog from an old sci-fi film, \xe2\x80\x9cPeanuts\xe2\x80\x9d) and more.' b'The fact that \xe2\x80\x9cOnly in Dreams\xe2\x80\x9d is eight glorious minutes long is Blue\xe2\x80\x99s greatest example of self-indulgence gone right. It confronts the two most perilous teen-boy anxieties\xe2\x80\x94talking to a girl you really like and dancing in public. It\xe2\x80\x99s fiery, gorgeous, well-played, and devastatingly sad. Sharp\xe2\x80\x99s trudging bassline\xc2\xa0guides the way forward for the narrator, whose fear of stepping on his crush\xe2\x80\x99s toenails is temporarily silenced by the band\xe2\x80\x99s total calamity. Rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll teaches us that extreme volume can quiet the voices of doubt inside our heads and numb the pain of living inside our awkward bodies. In this sense, the climaxes on \xe2\x80\x9cOnly in Dreams,\xe2\x80\x9d starting around the song\xe2\x80\x99s midpoint, are rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll lessons of a lifetime. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the big\xc2\xa0build at the 6:45 mark that plays like a beta male transfiguration. Having re-recorded Cropper\xe2\x80\x99s guitar parts in one take after essentially firing him following Blue\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 recording at Electric Lady, Cuomo ends up axe-battling himself until he\xe2\x80\x99s soloing like the metal gods he grew up worshipping. Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s drumming\xe2\x80\x94an underrated and idiosyncratic force throughout Weezer\xe2\x80\x99s discography\xe2\x80\x94drives home the catharsis. His cymbals crash from every angle and his tricky rolls play like percussive triple axels. By the end of the song, you\xe2\x80\x99re back to reality, exhausted but ready for a fight\xe2\x80\x94even if it\xe2\x80\x99s just against your own doubting voices.' b'For all the talk about Rivers Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s anemic masculinity, The Blue Album has a unifying thread of identity that supersedes gender. An essay on the Smiths pointed out that, \xe2\x80\x9cAsking people about their interest in the Smiths is another way of asking this question: \xe2\x80\x98How did you survive your teenage years?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d The same could be said of Weezer\xe2\x80\x99s debut. Blue\xc2\xa0quivers with isolation if you look past the pastiche, the deflective humor, and the guitar lines that make you sit up tall. The emotion\xc2\xa0Weezer tapped into is echoed in music sometimes considered distinctly millennial due to its high levels of anxiety, from Death Cab for Cutie and Car Seat\xc2\xa0Headrest to\xc2\xa0Mitski\xe2\x80\x99s Puberty 2\xc2\xa0and even\xc2\xa0Drake at his most neurotic.' b'For as classic as the album is considered now,\xc2\xa0Blue didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the 1994 Pazz & Jop year-end critics\xe2\x80\x99 poll. Back then, Weezer were considered alt opportunists or even Pavement ripoffs\xe2\x80\x94a comparison that seems silly now, looking at the distinct rock strains since indebted to Cuomo. But MTV and radio airplay for \xe2\x80\x9cBuddy Holly\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cUndone \xe2\x80\x94 The Sweater Song\xe2\x80\x9d made Weezer huge, and\xc2\xa0The Blue Album went double-platinum within 15 months of its release. Over the next three years, as Weezer 1.0 slowly imploded (bye-bye Matt Sharp, hello rotating door of bassists), the record would sell a million more and be well on its way to canonization. By 2003, Pitchfork named it one of the best records of the 1990s; two years later, Rolling Stone heralded it as the 299th greatest album ever. And so Blue now sits in a sweet spot of commercial accessibility and critical adoration, a combination that guarantees the album will make its way into the hands of a certain kind of bespectacled teenager for decades to come\xe2\x80\x94the ones who really need it. Cuomo never wrote a song as indelible as \xe2\x80\x9cSmells Like Teen Spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0but he did reach generations of rock kids, proving that coolness is optional if you study hard enough.'"
b'Kingdom',6.7,b'Tears in the Club',0,b'Electronic',b'February 25 2017',"b'Ezra Rubin\xe2\x80\x99s debut LP\xc2\xa0is an earnest and subdued attempt at making his soulful, ominous, post-club\xc2\xa0productions agreeable to a general audience.'","b'Ezra Rubin (aka Kingdom) is an architect of the post-club sound\xe2\x80\x94a new profile cleaved from caustic synthesizers, herky jerk percussion, and crying on the dancefloor. The melting pot of sounds he and his collaborators in Fade to Mind (Nguzunguzu, Total Freedom) and Night Slugs (Bok Bok, L-Vis 1990) offered pulled from UK garage, dancehall, and diva-driven house that still seems prescient. Rubin, in particular, helped shaped a postmodern vision of R&B alongside Kelela and Dawn Richard that\xe2\x80\x99s influenced everyone from FKA twigs to Justin Bieber. Rubin was staged to make a pop crossover. His debut LP, the delightfully titled Tears in the Club, is an earnest and subdued attempt at making his panoply of sounds agreeable to a general audience.' b'This is immediately clear from the album\xe2\x80\x99s opening moment, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Is Love,\xe2\x80\x9d a collaboration with SZA. Rubin is no stranger to producing for powerhouse vocalists, but with *Tears in the Club *he dips his toe into the world of major label team-ups, and the result has neutered the outr\xc3\xa9 aspects of his sound. On \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Is Love,\xe2\x80\x9d certain trademarks still pop up\xe2\x80\x94vaporous synth pulses and staccato percussion\xe2\x80\x94but he\xe2\x80\x99s slowed down the normally breakneck pace of his music to somewhere sleepier and almost lackadaisical. In the past, Rubin\xe2\x80\x99s slow jams (Dawn Richards \xe2\x80\x9cPaint It Blue\xe2\x80\x9d for example) had a seething atmosphere just bubbling beneath the surface. With SZA, that feel is gone. This is also true of some of his solo tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cNurtureworld\xe2\x80\x9d is a confusingly out-of-focus dance track that spends most of its three minutes finding its proper footing, and the album\xe2\x80\x99s title track is a defanged version of the controlled chaos he once offered.' b'Yet, Kingdom recovers from these missteps. \xe2\x80\x9cEach & Every Day,\xe2\x80\x9d his collaboration with Vine star Najee Daniels, adds a shot of bubblegum into his otherwise ominous productions. It resembles what Charli XCX would sound like singing over a DJ Rashad beat. His second song with SZA, \xe2\x80\x9cDown 4 Whatever,\xe2\x80\x9d benefits from the more vigorous, energetic beat Rubin provides. A solo track called \xe2\x80\x9cInto the Fold,\xe2\x80\x9d offers a\xc2\xa0picture of what pop-ified post-club music could sound like\xe2\x80\x94bright whacks of drums and smokey looped vocals mingle well with more experimental elements like a dissonant hiss in the background. But his thesis statement for this album comes on a song with the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s Syd, who might be the perfect vocalist for Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s attempt at a crossover style. Her slinky voice follows Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s syncopations beat for beat, and the protean, mercurial change in pace befits Syd\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pitch shift on the fly. It\xe2\x80\x99s a promising peek into what Kingdom could do for a radio-ready artist.' b'On a recent release, Vertical XL EP, Rubin filled inhuman sounds with soul, and *Tears in the Club *attempts to take that idea to a mass audience. One wonders if he is unintentionally softening his music for the sake of a breezier product. It\xe2\x80\x99s less a statement of purpose and more of an experiment with an inconclusive hypothesis. Instead of heightening, or focusing the pandemonium he could unleash on the dancefloor, his work is denatured by a fairweather disposition. Even if he never means to, *Tears in the Club *is a disappointingly genteel work, from an artist known for anything but.'"
b'King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard',7.4,b'Flying Microtonal Banana',0,b'Rock',b'February 25 2017',"b'On this sprawling new album, the Australian psych-rock band hoists its freak flag a few inches higher up the pole. It flutters in a more gentle breeze.'","b'King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are a testament to the liberating power of giving yourself restrictions. Whether making every song on a record the exact same length (2015\xe2\x80\x99s Quarters!), or constructing an entire album to connect into an infinite loop (last year\xe2\x80\x99s Nonagon Infinity), the Aussie armada thrive on the symbiotic relationship between governing principles and disorder. The result is psychedelic rock that\xc2\xa0plays like a pinball game\xe2\x80\x94the action may be confined to an enclosed playing field, but it\xe2\x80\x99s always moving, ping-ponging in unexpected directions and encouraging synapse overload.' b'The band\xe2\x80\x99s latest\xe2\x80\x94reportedly, the first of five albums they\xe2\x80\x99re planning to pump out this year\xe2\x80\x94is likewise bound to a motif, though this one is as much sonic as structural. Flying Microtonal Banana was the product of Gizzard king Stu Mackenzie acquiring a custom-made guitar modified for microtonal tuning, which allows for intervals smaller than the semitones that govern Western music. And since the new guitar could only be played with similarly tuned instruments, he reportedly paid his bandmates $200 each to also get their gear tricked out with microtonal capabilities. Translation for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t hold a degree in music theory: Australia\xe2\x80\x99s wiggiest band has found a way to hoist its freak flag a few inches higher up the pole. But this time, it flutters in a more gentle breeze.' b'If the unrelenting Nonagon Infinity turned rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll into an Iron Man competition, Flying Microtonal Banana is that cool-down grace period your elliptical machine gives you after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s workout. While opener \xe2\x80\x9cRattlesnake\xe2\x80\x9d immediately reestablishes the preceding album\xe2\x80\x99s motorik momentum, the pace is tempered\xe2\x80\x94more late-night cruise than rocket to the moon. But even as it maintains a steadier course, the changes in scenery are more dramatic\xe2\x80\x94in between Mackenzie\xe2\x80\x99s chirpy verses about reptilian attacks, the song powers through a fog of stormy synths, staccato guitar pricks, and the brain-scrambling squawks of a Turkish horn-type instrument known as a zurna.' b'On Nonagon Infinity, the action moved so fast that Mackenzie\xe2\x80\x99s words whizzed by like an out-of-control news ticker spitting out the haziest cosmic jive. He still drops randomly recurring melodies like a pull-string doll with a limited repertoire of phrasing, but Flying Microtonal Banana\xe2\x80\x99s more relaxed vibe and greater sense of space bring his words into sharper focus. As per psych-rock tradition, Mackenzie deals in surrealist imagery, though in this case, those images aren\xe2\x80\x99t the mere product of a chemically clouded mind. \xe2\x80\x9cMelting\xe2\x80\x9d combines rhythms from \xe2\x80\x9970s Nigeria with observations on the present-day Arctic (\xe2\x80\x9cToxic air is/Here to scare us/Fatal fumes from/Melting ferrous\xe2\x80\x9d). \xe2\x80\x9cOpen Water\xe2\x80\x9d channels anxieties over disappearing coastlines into a marauding, seafaring-fantasy epic, like an updated \xe2\x80\x9cImmigrant Song\xe2\x80\x9d for Vikings who drive their ships to new lands only discover they\xe2\x80\x99ve been swallowed by rising ocean levels.' b'Flying Microtonal Banana peaks early with these extended odysseys, before giving way to more conventionally scaled rockers like \xe2\x80\x9cSleep Drifter,\xe2\x80\x9d the rare Gizzard track that uses its melody as the foundation for a krautrockin\xe2\x80\x99 jam, rather than the other way around. But as the record rolls on, it starts to resemble an FM dial spun awry. Flying Microtonal Banana\xc2\xa0serves\xc2\xa0up brief blasts of spaghetti-western balladry (\xe2\x80\x9cBillabong Valley\xe2\x80\x9d), acidic Southern blooze (\xe2\x80\x9cAnoxia\xe2\x80\x9d), and gritty Afro-funk (\xe2\x80\x9cNuclear Fusion\xe2\x80\x9d) that are connected only by the chaotic harmonica and zurna bursts that punctuate Mackenzie\xe2\x80\x99s musings. And it becomes increasingly clear that the only difference between a three-minute King Gizzard track and a seven-minute one is where they arbitrarily decide to fade out (sometimes mid-chorus). But if Flying Microtonal Banana\xe2\x80\x99s randomized approach is ultimately less transfixing than Nonagon Infinity\xe2\x80\x99s maniacal focus, it nonetheless shows that, after eight previous\xc2\xa0albums, this band\xe2\x80\x99s creativity and curiosity knows no bounds, and their singular balance of anarchy and accessibility is still in check. So even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the first thing about microtonality, there\xe2\x80\x99s still plenty of flying banana here to keep you amused.'"

The Portland group began after the genre\xe2\x80\x99s first wave, but they\xe2\x80\x99re so well-versed in dramatic, soundtrack-ready instrumentalism that they could pass for originators in a blindfold test. Through seven\xc2\xa0albums over 15 years, they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a convincing case for the potential and durability of post-rock, covering diverse terrain\xe2\x80\x94metal, psych, krautrock, ambience, soft rock\xe2\x80\x94while maintaining a consistent musical language.' b'In fact, Grails\xe2\x80\x99 language is so strong that the six year gap between their last album, 2011\xe2\x80\x99s Deep Politics, and their new effort Chalice Hymnal feels like a mere blip. The group\xe2\x80\x94sometimes a sextet, for now a trio\xe2\x80\x94continues their wordless conversation so smoothly that one song, \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Snow II,\xe2\x80\x9d actually picks up almost exactly where Deep Politics\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Snow\xe2\x80\x9d left off. In line with their career trajectory, this album differs from its predecessor only because Grails have subtly deepened\xc2\xa0their sonic scope, committing even more\xc2\xa0to each of the many styles they\xe2\x80\x99ve explored in the past.' b'Yet there\xe2\x80\x99s no gratuitous novelty in Chalice Hymnal\xe2\x80\x99s 11 tracks. Expansion is a goal, but it\xe2\x80\x99s never the main point. As compositionally complex and technically adept as their songs are, Grails are always most interested in building moods and evoking emotions: somber reflection, energized optimism, wistful nostalgia, and most often, cathartic release. At times they prioritize mood-building\xc2\xa0to a fault, like when the misty \xe2\x80\x9cRebecca\xe2\x80\x9d veers toward easy listening. But if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to err, better that they lean toward the overly sentimental than the wankily proficient.' b'There\xe2\x80\x99s not many errors on *Chalice Hymnal, *though, since Grails are too experienced and familiar with their own strengths to let anything egregious slip past. Each track establishes a tone firmly and executes it confidently. Hence the chugging groove of \xe2\x80\x9cPelham,\xe2\x80\x9d the sludgy riffery of \xe2\x80\x9cNew Prague,\xe2\x80\x9d and the theatrical swells of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Moth & the Flame\xe2\x80\x9d feel like tonal siblings even though they\xe2\x80\x99re stylistically disparate. Some tracks even contrast themselves: \xe2\x80\x9cTough Guy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99s majestic march gives way to clouds of ambience before returning to forward motion.' b'None of that variety would matter if Chalice Hymnal wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so emotionally resonant. Grails understand that post-rock is largely about structure\xe2\x80\x94the way sounds gather and escalate, the way each part reflects what came before and points toward what\xe2\x80\x99s next\xe2\x80\x94and their mastery comes from treating music as sonic architecture. On Chalice Hymnal, they\xe2\x80\x99ve added another solid story to their growing skyscraper.'"
b'Alison Krauss',5.9,b'Windy City',0,b'Folk/Country',b'February 25 2017',"b""Her first solo record since 1999 is mildly ambitious and sounds spectacular, but\xc2\xa0Windy City is not a great showcase of Allison Krauss' crossover sound.""","b'The easy listening criticism has dogged Alison Krauss for more than twenty years, and she does nothing to dispel it on Windy City, her first solo record since 1999. Her music is thoughtfully poised between the bluegrass she grew up playing as a fiddle prodigy and the jazzy mainstream adult pop popularized by Norah Jones. At least since the O Brother Where Art Thou? soundtrack made her voice so famous, she has focused more on singing than playing the fiddle. That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a bad thing, as Krauss has a bright, soft soprano that at its best blends Dolly Parton\xe2\x80\x99s cheery expressiveness with Willie Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s dexterous phrasing. The downside, however, is that her music, while expertly performed and recorded, is often blanched of any distinguishing twang or genre character. The listening becomes too easy.' b'As though addressing that criticism directly, Windy City includes a cover of the 1967 crossover hit \xe2\x80\x9cGentle on My Mind,\xe2\x80\x9d written by John Hartford but made famous by Glen Campbell. The song lives right at the intersection of pop and country, its lyrics even describing how the music should operate: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re movin\xe2\x80\x99 on the back roads by the rivers of my memory/And for hours you\xe2\x80\x99re just gentle on my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d Krauss isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first female singer to take a shot at the song\xe2\x80\x94Aretha, Patti Page, and the Band Perry have all recorded versions\xe2\x80\x94but she does unintentionally show just how tricky the song can be. While her voice is perfectly suited to the song\xe2\x80\x99s rosy nostalgia, she can\xe2\x80\x99t quite navigate the narrative twist in the last verse, when the narrator is revealed to be not just a wanderer but literally homeless, haunting trainyards and barrel fires with a coal-dark beard and a dirty hat.' b""Krauss doesn't conjure that kind of character of setting, but then again, Campbell himself barely could. Still, he knew enough to play up the contrast between the grittiness of the circumstances and the gentleness of the memory. This version is all gentle: technically sharp but emotionally blunted. That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem throughout Windy City, as her pursuit of a viable crossover sound opens up new musical possibilities even as it burnishes away the genre edges of these songs. Working with Nashville producer Buddy Cannon, Krauss displays a broad palette, covering left-of-center choices from the Osborne Brothers and Roger Miller, Brenda Lee and country songwriting legend Cindy Walker. But the arrangements on opener \xe2\x80\x9cLosing You\xe2\x80\x9d and the title track don\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to evoke the messiness of actual loss. They\xe2\x80\x99re stately and elegant, but also cold and detached."" b'Windy City sounds liveliest whenever Krauss gets away from crossover pop. She navigates the twisting rhythms of the honky-tonk hit \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Good-Bye and So Long To You\xe2\x80\x9d with a jazzy agility and actually sounds like she\xe2\x80\x99s having fun with it. Likewise, her version of the bluegrass chestnut \xe2\x80\x9cPoison Love\xe2\x80\x9d has a calypso pulse that seems to defy gravity. Even \xe2\x80\x9cRiver in the Rain\xe2\x80\x9d retains its showtune determinism: If this Roger Miller obscurity, penned for a Huck Finn musical, is the album\xe2\x80\x99s centerpiece, it\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0because Krauss keeps it anchored to the stage. She sounds more at home with that kind of theatrical drama than she does with a story-song like the title\xc2\xa0track or \xe2\x80\x9cGentle on My Mind.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'Windy City is not the best place for newcomers to start with Krauss. The curious should search out the 1995 retrospective Now That I\xe2\x80\x99ve Found You, which features a savvier, more imaginative crossover sound. Windy City never quite reconciles her genre history with her populist ambitions, creating an album that toggles back and forth between the two poles and then ends abruptly. Krauss conveys a stately heartbreak in her closing cover of the Cindy Walker/Eddy Arnold classic \xe2\x80\x9cYou Don\xe2\x80\x99t Know Me,\xe2\x80\x9d striking the ideal balance between elegant countrypolitan backing, eccentric piano and pedal steel flourishes, and vocals that convey both power and personality. It\xe2\x80\x99d be a fine starting point for a follow-up.'"
b'Dirty Projectors',7.8,b'Dirty Projectors',0,b'Rock',b'February 24 2017',"b'In what is ostensibly a solo record with a few high-profile collaborations, Dave Longstreth masterfully peels away layer after layer of heartbreak across a strange, dizzying pop album.'","b'Like most people going through breakups, Dave\xc2\xa0Longstreth wants you to believe he\xe2\x80\x99s doing just fine. The nine songs on *Dirty Projectors *delve into\xc2\xa0his separation from former bandmate and girlfriend Amber Coffman, whose arresting voice over the past decade was as vital to\xc2\xa0Dirty Projectors\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0sound as Longstreth\xe2\x80\x99s own yelps and howls. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to ignore the context of the record, largely because Longstreth makes it impossible to forget. He\xe2\x80\x99s quick to admit that \xe2\x80\x9ca song isn\xe2\x80\x99t a newspaper\xe2\x80\x9d and that Dirty Projectors isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely autobiographical, even if the album\xe2\x80\x99s narrator sings about writing a tune called \xe2\x80\x9cStillness Is the Move.\xe2\x80\x9d Memoiristic or not, he\xe2\x80\x99s found a way to express the lonely anthologizing of events that matter only to you and one other person, couched within a strange, dizzying pop record.' b'For a band who once felt like an army of mannered Brooklynites and is now ostensibly the solo project of one bearded Longstreth, Dirty Projectors have always brought pop music to their homemade sound. Since his last album, 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Swing Lo Magellan, Longstreth has worked alongside Rihanna, Kanye West, and Solange (who co-wrote this album\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCool Your Heart\xe2\x80\x9d). But much of Dirty Projectors takes its inspiration from further back, comfort food for someone who may very well be nostalgic for the halcyon days of 2009. The stop-and-start buzz of \xe2\x80\x9cDeath Spiral\xe2\x80\x9d is as delirious and slick as a Futuresex/Lovesounds interlude. \xe2\x80\x9cCool Your Heart,\xe2\x80\x9d with its fancy-car music video and massive chorus, is a feel-good R&B trade-off with D\xe2\x88\x86WN that calls back to the same era of weirdo pop duets as Moby and Gwen Stefani\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSouth Side.\xe2\x80\x9d The music on Dirty Projectors sounds like the propulsive, hyper-curated nostalgia you put on to forget your heartbreak.' b'Instead, Longstreth uses it to help reveal what hurts. In the stunning \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Bubble,\xe2\x80\x9d he lies around the house, cursing his \xe2\x80\x9cdumb and meaningless\xe2\x80\x9d dreams and longing for death. In \xe2\x80\x9cWinner Take Nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflects on a broken relationship, unable to find anything positive to say in its wake. \xe2\x80\x9cThis has turned me against myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, \xe2\x80\x9cIn losing you, I lost myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0For anyone wondering what Kanye song he was listening to on the Taconic Parkway in \xe2\x80\x9cUp in Hudson,\xe2\x80\x9d my money\xe2\x80\x99s on \xe2\x80\x9cBlame Game,\xe2\x80\x9d when Kanye fragments his vocals to represent the myriad demons haunting him at once. Longstreth incorporates a similar tactic throughout the album, pitch-shifting his voice, distorting and layering it to mimic the hocketing sound that\xe2\x80\x99s long defined his songwriting. But what once felt whimsical and communal now sounds suffocating and paranoid. Longstreth is trying to escape himself.' b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe love is a competition that makes us raise the bar/We better ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings on \xe2\x80\x9cWork Together,\xe2\x80\x9d a selfish way to define a relationship but a\xc2\xa0viewpoint\xc2\xa0that seems to have inspired a sense of confidence. Using this freedom to find new collaborators like Solange and Tyondai Braxton, Longstreth has refined and upgraded himself, becoming bolder\xc2\xa0in the process. In fact, Dirty Projectors, in its own warped way, might be the sharpest, tightest record he\xe2\x80\x99s made yet. Like Joni Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s epic \xe2\x80\x9cPaprika Plains,\xe2\x80\x9d which layered a sweeping string arrangement over an autobiographical improv piano piece, *Dirty Projectors\xe2\x80\x99 *ornate arrangements can\xe2\x80\x99t hide the fact that these songs are as direct and unguarded as Longstreth allows himself to get.' b""The fatal flaw in this work, the same one that\xe2\x80\x99s haunted every Dirty Projectors album from the elaborate Black Flag rewrites of Rise Above to the faux-folksy love songs of Swing Lo Magellan, is the feeling of conceptual overload. But overthinking is a core part of Longstreth\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic and here it balances the drag of a post-breakup bloodletting, when even the album's title feels, to say the least, confrontational. You can hear Longstreth analyzing his thoughts in real time throughout these songs, sometimes finding a sense of resolution in the process. On the closing track, \xe2\x80\x9cI See You,\xe2\x80\x9d he reaches for a happy ending in the most characteristic song on the whole album\xe2\x80\x94it\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing here that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sound out of place on Bitte Orca. But the lyrics hint at a transformation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe projection has faded away,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings right after\xc2\xa0landing on a line that\xe2\x80\x99s extremely corny, slightly condescending, and maybe even romantic: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that the love we made is the art,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings sternly. He knows it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect, but for now, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best he\xe2\x80\x99s got."""

The\xc2\xa0quartet\xe2\x80\x99s self-titled debut grafts Gender Bender\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic vocal style onto the Melvin\xe2\x80\x99s rhythmic trudge\xe2\x80\x94apparent immediately on opener \xe2\x80\x9cChiseler,\xe2\x80\x9d a quick-and-dirty uptempo riff rocker.

This time, though, Osborne\xc2\xa0may have found a\xc2\xa0long lost twin in Gender Bender. She comes across as more vulnerable and agitated, but Gender Bender also shares Osborne\xe2\x80\x99s penchant for stagy, absurdist delivery. Here, she practically plays the role of Osborne\xe2\x80\x99s alter-ego, only with a relish that charges the Melvins\xe2\x80\x99 sound with an urgency it typically lacks.\xc2\xa0And by introducing a harmonic breadth the Melvins have never captured before, she brings new contours to their ongoing fascination with re-appropriating Sabbath, Kiss, and other classic rock tropes.' b'Gender Bender has a flash of mad inspiration on \xe2\x80\x9cDrugs on the Bus.\xe2\x80\x9d Her Farfisa part meanders spiderlike across the sludgy main riff, and when she wails about a woman who cuts her own eyes out in the climax, the mood intensifies starkly. She\xc2\xa0gets to channel her inner Jello Biafra on a cover of \xe2\x80\x9980s hardcore outfit Tales of Terror\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPossession,\xe2\x80\x9d which recalls the springy cadence of the Dead Kennedys classic \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia \xc3\x9cber Alles.\xe2\x80\x9d And while\xc2\xa0the funereal riff that anchors \xe2\x80\x9cMoth Tongue\xe2\x80\x9d is indistinguishable from countless other Melvins tunes,\xc2\xa0Gender Bender scrapes the back of her throat on her high notes, allowing a glimpse of what the Melvins might\xc2\xa0sound like if fronted by the banshee wail of Rush\xe2\x80\x99s Geddy Lee.' b'Crystal Fairy concludes on an anticlimactic note, as the final stop-start stutter of the short-fast \xe2\x80\x9cVampire X-Mas\xe2\x80\x9d simply fails to resume when the band has set you up to expect that it will. It\xc2\xa0sounds\xc2\xa0intentional, but the track also\xc2\xa0leaves a lingering feeling that the album ends\xc2\xa0unresolved. That\xe2\x80\x99s a minor\xc2\xa0quibble, though, after 40-minutes of hearing people play together with far greater affinity than anyone could have expected.'"

It\xe2\x80\x99s a motley group that speaks to the spiky strangeness inherent in the continent\xe2\x80\x99s figures. But leave it to Michael Kucyk (host of Noise in My Head on NTS Radio) to unearth the sounds being made in Australia far off the radar. His Efficient Space label has already pulled out some blissful Australian house, weirdo new wave and last year\xe2\x80\x99s stark but haunting\xc2\xa0Sky Girl\xc2\xa0compilation.' b'The ten tracks on\xc2\xa0Oz Waves might be their most peculiar set yet. Culled by a DJ who goes by the handle of Steele Bonus (he also has a series of thrilling Soundcloud mixes), he\xe2\x80\x99s unearthed rare examples of Australian DIY rendered in the \xe2\x80\x9980s amid the macho pub rock sound of the decade. With most Aussie major labels wholly uninterested in such strange drum machine-laced sounds (though INXS did have a penchant for dub weirdness), most artists and short-lived bands opted instead to make artful cassette-zines instead. As the Oz Waves notes attest, many were dubbed in editions ranging from 5 to 100 copies.' b""Not that any of the acts had dreams of pop stardom when they plugged in their guitars, Groovebox drum machines, and primitive synths to make their lo-fi din. Bands bearing names like Ironing Music, He Dark Age and the Horse He's Sick don\xe2\x80\x99t really have Top of the Pops in mind. These bands revel in freedom, knowing that with no major labels, no crowds to perform in front of and, for the most part, no drummer, they were free to document the strangest noises that sprung from their heads. It\xe2\x80\x99s ostensibly punk rock, but 30 years on, time has a way of changing such meanings. The primitive beats and befuddling noises that bounce off the walls of each song make it come across as endearingly insular dance music."" b'Much like New Yorkers in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s who identified more as art collectives than bands, the acts here also dabbled in video art, painting, and visual design.\xc2\xa0Irena Xero was on the Brisbane punk scene in the late \xe2\x80\x9970s but also into cross-discipline arts. She sounds like a one-woman automaton on \xe2\x80\x9cLady on the Train,\xe2\x80\x9d programming chilly handclaps and delivering lines with even less affect than Nico. Andy Rantzen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWill I Dream?\xe2\x80\x9d went unreleased in 1989, but it makes sense considering he soon moved from doing industrial-styled noise to making rave tracks. Deeming it the most dancefloor-friendly track in the set seems like a misnomer, as it\xe2\x80\x99s a strange puddle of funky bass and peppy snare, flickering sinewaves, submarine alarms and mewling voices.' b""While Prod\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cKnife on Top\xe2\x80\x9d features a limber Can-like groove to it and Zerox Dreamflesh do woozy Augustus Pablo-esque dub on \xe2\x80\x9cSquids Can Fly,\xe2\x80\x9d most bands here prefer sputtering drum machines, which make for the set\xe2\x80\x99s most charming moments.

b'Future',7.3,b'FUTURE',0,b'Rap',b'February 23 2017',"b'The first of two albums released within seven days of each other,\xc2\xa0FUTURE is an ambitious Future exhibition, but replicating his brightest moments is often a hit or miss proposition.'","b'Future is certainly a prolific artist, though\xc2\xa0it is getting a bit excessive. Since 2011, he has released at least two projects every year, often three or more. His work ethic, long a point of personal pride, paid big dividends across an excellent mixtape trilogy (Monster, Beast Mode, and 56 Nights) in the run up to his commercial peak with Dirty Sprite 2\xc2\xa0and his cash-in collaboration with Drake, What a Time to Be Alive. Since then, his music is either chasing those highs or stuck in cruise control. His Purple Reign\xc2\xa0tape introduced some moving new deep cuts to his catalog\xc2\xa0but was modest by his standards and he rushed out EVOL\xc2\xa0a month later for an Apple exclusive. His new self-titled album is the first in a pair of projects released in a seven-day span. Perhaps for Future, prolificity is about excess, not just because it\xe2\x80\x99s a flex, but because it always requires giving more of oneself\xe2\x80\x94almost too much. Both nonstop motion and overindulgence are in his DNA. FUTURE, in many ways, unmasks Future: he\xe2\x80\x99s a creature of habit.' b""The Atlanta rapper has funneled most of his music through three personas: Super Future, Fire Marshal Future, and Future Hendrix (he explained them as the hitmaker, the party packer, and the rockstar, respectively). The alter egos have characterized much of his output, giving names to his various aesthetics. FUTURE is meant as a Future exhibition, a portrayal of his many sides\xe2\x80\x94superstar, romantic, heartbreaker, hedonist\xe2\x80\x94which have previously only been showcased in flashes. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything past Future projects haven\xe2\x80\x99t done already, and ironically it doesn't tell us anything new about Future."" b'Even under these circumstances, FUTURE is true to form for Future in both content (the first lines rapped are \xe2\x80\x9cGot the money coming in, it ain\xe2\x80\x99t no issues/I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you\xe2\x80\x9d), and the sounds he chooses to channel. A song like \xe2\x80\x9cPoppin Tags\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cCommas\xe2\x80\x9d-esque and \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Trapper\xe2\x80\x9d is forged in the image of 56 Nights\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cTrap Niggas\xe2\x80\x9d; both are indicative of Super Future, lining pounding 808 bass with clustered raps. \xe2\x80\x9cFlip\xe2\x80\x9d is reminiscent of 2013 one-offs like \xe2\x80\x9cFinessin\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d with warping synths and cracked vocals. The ballad \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I Was Broke\xe2\x80\x9d harkens back to the romanticism of Honest or \xe2\x80\x9cTurn On the Lights.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'There are bits and pieces of nearly every part of his past here, but replicating his brightest moments is a hit or miss proposition. In bringing all these previous personas together, he creates an album that\xe2\x80\x99s mostly retreads. And there are a few moments that completely lack Future\xe2\x80\x99s patented dynamism and evocation, particularly \xe2\x80\x9cGood Dope\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cScrape.\xe2\x80\x9d But even on autopilot, Future can churn out some truly high octane flows (\xe2\x80\x9cPOA\xe2\x80\x9d), sweetly-sung gun ballads (\xe2\x80\x9cDraco\xe2\x80\x9d), and some pleasant surprises (like the hum-heavy throbber \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m So Groovy\xe2\x80\x9d).' b'The highlights come when Future journeys into uncharted waters or deep into his own memory bank. \xe2\x80\x9cI lost so many niggas to the streets this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he opens on the affecting cut \xe2\x80\x9cFeds Did a Sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t even talkin\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98bout,\xe2\x80\x9d he pauses to clarify. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t even dead.\xe2\x80\x9d The song recounts days trafficking drugs to survive, police raids orchestrated to suppress said trafficking, and state-sanctioned oppression against black ghettos, all while using intensely lucid writing (\xe2\x80\x9cStarted cooking work and skipping Chemistry\xe2\x80\x9d). Like \xe2\x80\x9cFeds,\xe2\x80\x9d the ominous \xe2\x80\x9cMask Off\xe2\x80\x9d tells a similar tale of crime as a means to survive poverty, but it relinquishes the former\xe2\x80\x99s mournful tone, opting instead to be brazen\xe2\x80\x94doing a robbery without a mask is reckless and implies either carelessness or apathy. He takes drastic measures: \xe2\x80\x9cMy guillotine, drank promethazine/Tec and beams, go to those extremes.\xe2\x80\x9d The two songs have some symmetry\xe2\x80\x94in one, Future is the raider; in the other, the raided. These encounters provide a counterbalance to all the braggadocio and a sharper, behind-the-scenes look at the world that shaped him.' b'Sonically, FUTURE plays with a pretty interesting array of textures, from the Arcade Fire-sampling minimalist piano chord on \xe2\x80\x9cMight As Well\xe2\x80\x9d to the whiny, xylophonic chimes on \xe2\x80\x9cZoom\xe2\x80\x9d to the wobbly frets screeching on \xe2\x80\x9cOutta Time.\xe2\x80\x9d Some songs mimic the unpredictable strobe of a laser light show; others induce oriental flute music. Some are fixed, oscillating to and from a single point (like \xe2\x80\x9cPOA\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFlip\xe2\x80\x9d). Others are slightly off-balance (\xe2\x80\x9cMassage in My Room\xe2\x80\x9d). But its drum kit patterns are beginning to sound old hat, perhaps a result of overtaxing the same core group of producers (Metro Boomin, Southside, Zaytoven, and Tarentino) the last few years. The songs almost all have the same exact pulse, but they usually manage to intrigue with subtle tonal shifts.' b""Seventeen tracks is clearly a profusion, but it's a fitting display given Future\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to mass production. The glut of songs create a sampler that allows listeners to pick and choose a handful of favorites, and the cult classics will likely be the ones that make it into his sets. Future has a formula now. That means that we can expect less spontaneity and more sustainability. FUTURE is a fine mix of the stylings of past Futures layered in a rich blend of sounds from a now refined sonic palette. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t communicate the same intense and complicated emotional concoction that fills his songs when he\xe2\x80\x99s at his most vulnerable and compelling. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. It is prototypical of Future, who continues to overshare, often for better but sometimes for worse. He will continue to do the things that allowed him to reach this point: amp up the output, stay active, and feed a ravenous, culture-obsessed public. That is, until he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to surprise us again."""
b'Strand of Oaks',6.5,b'Hard Love',0,b'Rock',b'February 23 2017',"b'The\xc2\xa0latest Strand of Oaks album\xc2\xa0has a sunnier outlook and a hedonistic streak, evoking Creation Records bands like Primal Scream and Oasis.\xc2\xa0But it\xc2\xa0never really adds up to a bold statement.'","b'On 2014\xe2\x80\x99s HEAL, his fifth album as Strand of Oaks, Timothy Showalter emerged as his own most compelling lead character. Showalter was a grown-up adolescent still mired in dark thoughts and intense desires: for the opposite sex, for self-eradication through drugs or worse, for his favorite song to come on the radio. Making or simply listening to music was a lifeline out of the confusion of youth and the disappointments of adulthood, which informed a song cycle simultaneously bleak and optimistic, as big as an arena yet as personal as an inner monologue. Showalter reminisced about \xe2\x80\x9csinging Pumpkins in the mirror,\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine his fans finding similar salvation in \xe2\x80\x9cJM\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGoshen \xe2\x80\x9997.\xe2\x80\x9d' b'And yet: \xe2\x80\x9cHEAL was bullshit, man.\xe2\x80\x9d In an exhaustive, candid Stereogum article, Showalter distanced himself from his breakthrough album, which he seems to think is too dark, too self-absorbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of being the sad white guy with an acoustic guitar\xe2\x80\xa6 We\xe2\x80\x99re done with that shit,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. There\xe2\x80\x99s not much acoustic guitar on the album, but that\xe2\x80\x99s besides the point: Newly committed to his marriage and to a sunnier outlook on everything, Showalter no longer wants to rip his soul out and play harrowing songs night after night. That\xe2\x80\x99s understandable: Who could fault the guy for wanting to be happy?' b'Consequently, Hard Love is more than a follow-up\xe2\x80\x94it sounds like\xc2\xa0a direct response to HEAL. These new songs are never quite as dark or as deep, never quite as probing, which is not to say they\xe2\x80\x99re superficial. Showalter seems to have made an effort not to sound quite as troubled. If his relationship to music once seemed desperate, he now sounds like a guy thrilled to be evoking\xc2\xa0Creation Records, one of the major touchstones on Hard Love. Featuring wobbly guitars and big drumbeats, \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Hill\xe2\x80\x9d nod to bands like Primal Scream, the Jesus & Mary Chain, and even Oasis without making too obvious a reference.' b'Instead of sulking in his car blasting Songs: Ohia, as he did on \xe2\x80\x9cJM,\xe2\x80\x9d Hard Love shows Showalter out in the world, engaging with other people through music and, notably, through drugs. This is a peculiarly hedonistic album, one that will doubtless play well on the summer festival circuit. \xe2\x80\x9cI have the good drugs now,\xe2\x80\x9d he boasts in that Stereogum article, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not especially potent sources of inspiration. Influenced\xc2\xa0by a mind-expanding episode at Boogie Festival in Australia, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Hill\xe2\x80\x9d bounds forward with a big, brash sound, but it never really goes anywhere. Instead, it just stays on that hill, blissed out and barely relatable if you weren\xe2\x80\x99t at Boogie and on those good drugs with him.' b'More rewarding are the smaller moments, the songs that show Strand of Oaks morphing into a formidable rock band. \xe2\x80\x9cQuit It\xe2\x80\x9d is gloriously raw blues, \xe2\x80\x9cRest of It\xe2\x80\x9d a trash-glam stomp. Both sound tossed off in the best way: less burdened with concepts and therefore freer, more fun. They represent a more relatable form of hedonism, with Showalter simply rocking the fuck out. That less-is-more quality extends to those moments when everything falls away except for one or two instruments: The title track builds to a climactic chorus, but instead of pushing everything into the red, Showalter removes everything but the drums. It redefines and redirects the anthem, turning it into an overture for the album that follows.' b'Perhaps the oddest aspect of Hard Love is how far it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stray from HEAL. Everything sounds weirdly familiar, as though Showalter hasn\xe2\x80\x99t figured out how to move on from that breakthrough. He still makes the most of his murky production, despite bringing in French producer Nicolas Vernhes (Speedy Ortiz, Deerhunter) and multi-instrumentalist Jason Anderson. \xe2\x80\x9cRadio Kids\xe2\x80\x9d sounds a bit too similar to previous songs about adolescent alienation, and \xe2\x80\x9cSalt Brothers\xe2\x80\x9d leans too closely toward better cryptic anthems, most notably the apocalyptic \xe2\x80\x9cSterling,\xe2\x80\x9d off 2010\xe2\x80\x99s enduringly strange Pope Killdragon. Hard Love never really adds up to a particularly clear or bold statement; there are some strong songs and big moments, but very little that moves the story forward or develops that rich character. It\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly fine album by a guy who wants to be much more than perfectly fine.'"

Her powerful interpretation of American folk reclaims its old vernacular and redistributes it among its oft-untold complex history. After years of soaking up American musical traditions with her long-standing string band the Carolina Chocolate Drops, Giddens has emerged as a peerless voice of roots-minded music as a solo artist on her new album, comprised of original compositions alongside a few relevant covers, including the Staples Singers\xe2\x80\x99 1965 title track.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s beauty and gravitas come\xc2\xa0from how Giddens collapses the last two centuries of American history, \xc2\xa0juxtaposing songs about antebellum slave plantations with 1960\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Rights anthems and narratives of 21st-century state violence. The record opens with \xe2\x80\x9cAt the Purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s Option,\xe2\x80\x9d a title taken from a 1797 slave advertisement. The song\xe2\x80\x94a tale of a mother considering the doomed fate of their child born into bondage\xe2\x80\x94immediately establishes the primacy of family across the album. Despite its historical pretensions, Freedom Highway is fundamentally a story of black mothers and their children, a record that traces black women\xe2\x80\x99s eternal labor as they sacrifice for and grieve over the uncertain future of their kin.' b'Giddens has always been interested in upsetting the continuum of African-American song. She began experimenting with more recent, mid-late 20th-century styles on her solo debut, 2015\xe2\x80\x99s Tomorrow is My Turn, and she arrives at Freedom Highway with her most expansive and adventurous musical palette yet. Featured prominently are the banjo/fiddle string-band and Piedmont blues stylings she explored so deftly in the Carolina Chocolate Drops, but *Freedom Highway *weaves hip-hop, gospel, Dixieland jazz, folk balladry, and guitar-driven rhythm and blues into a coherent whole.' b'It remains challenging to find the right environment that fully modernizes Rhiannon Giddens\xe2\x80\x99 perfectly ornate soprano. But roots expert Dirk Powell, who produced the album, relies on understated, predominantly acoustic arrangements that end up humanizing her vocal approach more fully than the museum-piece elegance of T-Bone Burnett\xe2\x80\x99s production on Tomorrow is My Turn.' b'Likewise, the emotional intimacy of Giddens\xe2\x80\x99 first collection of original material is better served by the close collaborators and assorted family members who appear on Freedom Highway than the array of well-chopped session pros who populated her debut. Giddens\xe2\x80\x99 sister Lalenja Harrington, who co-wrote and shares vocals on \xe2\x80\x9cBaby Boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and her nephew, Justin Harrington, who raps a verse on the police brutality polemic \xe2\x80\x9cBetter Get It Right the First Time,\xe2\x80\x9d provide moments of dramatic interplay that firmly contemporize Giddens\xe2\x80\x99 creative vision.' b'As a songwriter, Giddens achieves immediacy by imbuing her stories with striking interpersonal drama and emotional depth. On the banjo tune \xe2\x80\x9cJulie,\xe2\x80\x9d one of several songs that take place during the Civil War, a heart-wrenching exchange between slave and mistress ends with a devastating narrative reveal. On the stomping \xe2\x80\x9cThe Love We Almost Had,\xe2\x80\x9d an otherwise unremarkable tale of romance-that-never-was becomes a tragic statement on the far-reaching bonds of white supremacy.' b""But the record's most affecting moment comes during \xe2\x80\x9cWe Could Fly,\xe2\x80\x9d a modern spiritual that traces a family\xe2\x80\x99s multi-generational search for enlightened freedom. The song delivers a rare gift from a piece of music: the sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s always existed, that it\xe2\x80\x99s always been sung, that it must have been written in 1854, and in 1963, and in 2016. That shared sense of African-American tradition is the driving force behind Giddens' art as she lays bare the ugly symmetry of America\xe2\x80\x99s history. Here is timeless, striking proof that what was once worth protesting in song 200 years ago remains every bit as vital today."""
b'Tim Darcy',7.0,b'Saturday Night',0,b'Rock',b'February 23 2017',"b'On this\xc2\xa0unsettled solo album, Ought frontman Tim Darcy slowly dismantles the confessional crooner archetype, transforming himself from singer-songwriter to sound sculptor.'","b'Saturday night has long been pop music\xe2\x80\x99s favorite part of the week\xe2\x80\x94a time for fighting, fevers, and over-excited group spelling bees. But if the cover of his first solo album is any indication, Tim Darcy likes to spend it alone with his plants. His Saturday Night isn\xe2\x80\x99t about going out on the town, but retreating inside his mind, following his wandering thoughts wherever they lead, even if they take him to some dark places. As frontman for Montreal quartet Ought, Darcy has, over the course of two records, emerged as one of indie rock\xe2\x80\x99s most wily and witty wordsmiths, channeling the daily absurdities and anxieties of modern urban life into twitchy post-punk screeds. By contrast, Saturday Night\xc2\xa0is more intimate in every way: in scale, in production, and most importantly, in its emotional vocabulary.' b'On the one hand, Saturday Night does exactly what you expect a solo record from a member of a raucous rock band to do: It\xe2\x80\x99s more off the cuff and rougher around the edges, and showcases a more introspective side than the day job normally allows. On the other hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s an assault on that very idea. Over its 11 songs (including one hidden one), Darcy slowly dismantles the confessional crooner archetype until he\xe2\x80\x99s just messing around with the raw materials, transforming himself from singer-songwriter to sound sculptor. And it becomes increasingly clear that, for Darcy, Saturday Night isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a reservoir for songs that don\xe2\x80\x99t quite fit his main band\xe2\x80\x99s m.o., but a portal to a world beyond rock\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99roll entirely.' b'From the outset, Saturday Night both plays to expectations and subverts them. Opening rave-up \xe2\x80\x9cTall Glass of Water\xe2\x80\x9d begins on familiar fidgety footing\xe2\x80\x94though it\xe2\x80\x99s a little more rickety than the typical Ought jam, the frenetic energy coursing through it makes the source easy enough to identify. But one minute in, Darcy brings the song\xe2\x80\x99s smash \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 grab momentum to a dead stop and reboots it as a cool mid-tempo strut\xe2\x80\x94as if he was playing Lou Reed\xe2\x80\x99s Transformer\xc2\xa0at 45 rpm and suddenly flipped it to 33. \xe2\x80\x9cWell the questions are being asked,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it fate or is it popsicle?\xe2\x80\x9d The meaning may not be clear, but the message is: we\xe2\x80\x99re on his melted clock now, and things are about to get surreal.' b'Saturday Night frontloads its most melodic moments, though even the sturdiest songs are outfitted with booby traps and escape hatches. \xe2\x80\x9cJoan Pt 1, 2\xe2\x80\x9d is a hit of woozy distorto-pop that free falls into an empty-cathedral chorale. \xe2\x80\x9cYou Felt Comfort\xe2\x80\x9d wraps warm \xe2\x80\x98n\xe2\x80\x99 fuzzy guitar strums around frank lyricism (\xe2\x80\x9cYou felt comfort and release/For a trauma that was making you weak\xe2\x80\x9d) in classic Neutral Milk Hotel fashion, before the rhythm suddenly drops out for the final verse as if the drummer was coin-operated. But the swooning \xe2\x80\x9cStill Waking Up\xe2\x80\x9d is Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s shiniest diamond in the rough. It strikes\xc2\xa0a perfectly Morrissey-esque balance of aching melancholy and arch meta-humor: \xe2\x80\x9cWaking up alone was always a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s night/\xe2\x80\x99Cause my head is full of popular songs/Old ones I never sang along to/Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny how that happens?\xe2\x80\x9d' b'But with the gleaming mid-album instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Final Days,\xe2\x80\x9d Darcy draws a line in the sand, closing the book on the album\xe2\x80\x99s more sanguine first act while anticipating the anti-pop provocations that await on side two. The title track is unlikely to join the pantheon of Saturday-night party songs, its claustrophobic psychosis rendered with a dirgey drumbeat, ear-piercing guitar scrapes, and Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s deadpan-to-panicked vocal. (\xe2\x80\x9cLet me out! And I\xe2\x80\x99ll run!\xe2\x80\x9d he pleads, as if a prisoner to his own song.) \xe2\x80\x9cFound My Limit\xe2\x80\x9d is less jarring, but its hypnotic avant-folk oscillations and Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s eerie, disembodied voice make it equally chilling. When Darcy gets back to more recognizable song forms on the psych-pop shanty \xe2\x80\x9cSaint Germain\xe2\x80\x9d and the drowsy piano-bar ballad \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99d You Release?,\xe2\x80\x9d they feel corrupted, as if infected by the preceding forays into free-form, found-sound disorder.' b'But if Saturday Night\xe2\x80\x99s drifting second act carries the sense of Darcy feeling and fumbling his way through the dark, he eventually finds the calm in chaos. The penultimate instrumental \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond Me\xe2\x80\x9d is Saturday Night\xe2\x80\x99s messiest song\xe2\x80\x94all trembling, corroded strings and random piano plinks\xe2\x80\x94but it\xe2\x80\x99s also the album\xe2\x80\x99s purest, most joyful expression, like the bleary-eyed moment of relief that hits you as the sun rises after a night of brutal insomnia. And with that, Darcy arrives at a place that\xe2\x80\x99s the complete inverse of Ought, both musically and philosophically: Rather than concern himself with navigating the outside world, with Saturday Night, he\xe2\x80\x99s produced a suitably unsettled soundtrack for just trying to keep your shit together on the inside.'"
b'Jidenna',5.8,b'The Chief',0,b'Pop/R&B',b'February 22 2017',"b'A versatile dandy, Jidenna tries on many different musical styles with his debut album\xe2\x80\x94but all that changing quickly grows tiresome.'","b'Jidenna cut a memorable figure when he emerged in 2015, looking like a roguish extra from a cancelled period drama: natty three-piece suit, slim cane with gilded accents, shiny cufflinks. He proved to be a shrewd repackager on \xe2\x80\x9cClassic Man,\xe2\x80\x9d which pulled from DJ Mustard\xe2\x80\x99s minimalist bounce and made it No. 22 on the Hot 100. But in his efforts to break out of one-hit-wonder-dom and demonstrate a wide range on his debut album The Chief, Jidenna sometimes comes off as shapeless.' b'You might have seen this coming: Jidenna has spent the past two years releasing a series of singles with the apparent goal of appearing on as many Spotify playlists as possible. \xe2\x80\x9cLong Live the Chief,\xe2\x80\x9d carried by a squeaky, nails-on-the-chalkboard synth tone, was a distant descendant of Jeru the Damaja\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 boom-bap classic \xe2\x80\x9cCome Clean;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cChief Don\xe2\x80\x99t Run\xe2\x80\x9d paired bluster with a beat that sounded like a more ornate version of Tyga\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRack City;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Bit More\xe2\x80\x9d seemed built for the express purpose of giving DJs something to play after Justin Bieber\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSorry.\xe2\x80\x9d' b""It turns out these singles offered just a sample of Jidenna\xe2\x80\x99s talents\xe2\x80\x94this is a man with a suit for every occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cTrampoline\xe2\x80\x9d channels festive brass, while \xe2\x80\x9cBambi\xe2\x80\x9d attempts an audacious combination of post-war crooning and of-the-moment drum programming. There\xe2\x80\x99s hammy singing with piano (or strings), more strains of pop-hip-hop, you name it, and the 31-year-old stacks a jumble of imagery on this changing bedrock. He loves animal metaphors\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cA lion don't ever lose sleep when it comes to sheep\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cshit\xe2\x80\x99s getting wild\xe2\x80\x94safari!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and drawing from a well worn selection of cultural titans: Frank Sinatra and the Dalai Lama, the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, James Bond (\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a Roger Moore nigger/I\xe2\x80\x99m a Sean Connery\xe2\x80\x9d)."" b'Between all the beasts of prey and Madame Tussauds-worthy famous figures, Jidenna also alludes to police violence and racial inequality, and these moments tend to be his sharpest. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot you down without warning,\xe2\x80\x9d he laments on \xe2\x80\x9cHelicopters,\xe2\x80\x9d displaying the hoarsest\xe2\x80\x94and strongest\xe2\x80\x94part of his voice. The most potent song on The Chief comes second to last: \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Niggas\xe2\x80\x9d imagines a white family that is struggling with addiction to prescription drugs and facing the same sort of systematic police oppression that afflicts black communities. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple premise with a big pay-off.' b'Jidenna tries on styles and allusions, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always fill them out or imbue them with personality. At a time when many rappers shift tone from syllable to syllable, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find little of that excitement on The Chief. He often delivers rapped lines conversationally and sings cleanly, but neither register has much character. Given this, his turn to the dancefloor on \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Bit More\xe2\x80\x9d represents a canny understanding of his strengths. In the business of making immensely popular songs for warm-weather events, the vocals are meant to be smooth\xe2\x80\x94any sort of burrs represent an impediment to frictionless forward locomotion. Here, where anonymity is prized, Jidenna sounds most comfortable.'"
b'Jens Lekman',8.0,b'Life Will See You Now',0,b'Rock',b'February 22 2017',"b'On his fourth album, Jens Lekman opens up in new ways. He narrates the vulnerability\xc2\xa0of others, works with a producer, and crafts pop songs\xc2\xa0that absorb disco, calypso, and samba to soften their ache.'","b'\xe2\x80\x9cPostcard #17\xe2\x80\x9d is the penultimate track on Jens Lekman\xe2\x80\x99s fourth album Life Will See You Now,\xc2\xa0and also its darkest. A morose Mingus-sampling piano ballad with handclaps and a disco backbeat, there\xe2\x80\x99s no cute story to unfurl, no quirky character to imbue pearls of wisdom. The tune follows the internal monologue of a writer struggling to believe in himself (\xe2\x80\x9cIf I just put this pen to this paper/If I just change the labels on the salt and pepper shaker/If I just trick myself into pouring it all out\xe2\x80\x9d), desperate to conquer the demons gnawing at his own sense of self-worth. Arguably the most fully formed track from his 2015\xc2\xa0Postcards project\xe2\x80\x94the album version is nearly identical to the original\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cPostcard #17\xe2\x80\x9d is a window into the headspace Lekman was in when\xc2\xa0he resolved to write and release a new song every week that year. It\xe2\x80\x99s a portrait of an artist, confused and fearful, trying to climb out of a hole of his own construction.' b'Lekman\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0descent into darkness can be traced back to 2008, when he sat in his teenage bedroom in Sweden to pen\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe End of the World is Bigger Than Love.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the first time he\xe2\x80\x99d managed to write\xc2\xa0about the woman who\xc2\xa0had broken his heart that year, and it became the starting point for 2012\xe2\x80\x99s I Know What Love Isn\xe2\x80\x99t, the followup to his 2007 breakout Night Falls Over Kortedala. The album would eschew the sample-heavy chamber pop pastiche of his oeuvre to date in favor 10 sparse, \xe2\x80\x9caerodynamic\xe2\x80\x9d takes on heartache. The subsequent tour was rough on Lekman\xe2\x80\x94performing the most painful songs he\xe2\x80\x99d ever written, night after night, to half-empty rooms waiting to hear the hits. His\xc2\xa0new songs were dark, and devoid of hope.' b'Lekman conceived the Postcards project to work through his despair. Only two of the 52 songs would make this\xc2\xa0album (#17 and #29, which became \xe2\x80\x9cHow We Met, The Long Version\xe2\x80\x9d), but the songwriting bootcamp helped lay its foundation. When the project caught the ear of the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, he used its\xc2\xa0commission to turn other people\xe2\x80\x99s stories into songs. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a part of me that was really sick of this Jens Lekman character, and I wanted to write myself out of my songs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The Ghostwriting project scratched that itch, but ultimately confirmed what Lekman\xe2\x80\x99s friends had already confessed to him: It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to become emotionally invested in a Jens Lekman tale\xc2\xa0when he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the characters.' b'It\xe2\x80\x99s fitting that Lekman would find himself through narrating\xc2\xa0the lives\xc2\xa0of others. His best work has always been\xc2\xa0defined not by fantastical tales of intrigue, but tender moments observed with an empathetic eye. On Life Will See You Now\xe2\x80\x99s opener, \xe2\x80\x9cTo Know Your Mission,\xe2\x80\x9d a teenage\xc2\xa0Lekman\xc2\xa0relates to a Mormon missionary that all he wants out of life is to listen to people\xe2\x80\x99s stories. When he sings \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6in a world of mouths/I want to be an ear/If there\xe2\x80\x99s a purpose to all this/Then that\xe2\x80\x99s why God put me here,\xe2\x80\x9d it feels less like a prescient self-assessment from a precocious teen than it does the wizened perspective of someone reflecting on their life.' b'The bright, joyous tones of \xe2\x80\x9cTo Know Your Mission\xe2\x80\x9d permeate\xc2\xa0Life Will See You Now, which marries the cohesion of I Know What Love Isn\xe2\x80\x99t with the diverse palette of his sample-driven chamber pop. The lush production may be thanks\xc2\xa0to Ewan Pearson, whose work on the LP marks the first time Lekman has used an outside producer. Each of the album\xe2\x80\x99s 10 tracks are fully formed pop songs, absorbing elements of disco, calypso, and samba, with upbeat rhythms that often belie the ache at their core. Bouncy bossa nova horns soundtrack a bride\xe2\x80\x99s existential crisis (\xe2\x80\x9cWedding in Finist\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x9d), a cancer survivor consoles his distraught friend amid a barrage of sunny \xe2\x80\x9cdoo doo doo\xe2\x80\x9ds (\xe2\x80\x9cEvening Prayer\xe2\x80\x9d), and Ralph MacDonald\xe2\x80\x99s steel drums flutter as Lekman tortures himself with the olfactory nostalgia of an ex-lover (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s That Perfume That You Wear?\xe2\x80\x9d). He plays with the dissonance, softening emotional blows with melodic confection. As a friend (Tracey Thorn) begs him to avoid a melancholy retelling of their nocturnal mischief on \xe2\x80\x9cHotwire the Ferris Wheel,\xe2\x80\x9d he indulges her: \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, if I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna write a song about this I promise I won\xe2\x80\x99t make it a sad song/You\xe2\x80\x99ll go like this: \xe2\x80\x98Woo!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d' b'A recurring theme of vulnerability dominates Life Will See You Now. Lekman\xe2\x80\x99s narrator\xc2\xa0explores the way\xc2\xa0new lovers slowly reveal themselves to each other (\xe2\x80\x9cOur First Fight\xe2\x80\x9d), and the emotional distance he creates by expecting the worst to happen (\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really see/How I built a bomb shelter under every dream,\xe2\x80\x9d he sings on \xe2\x80\x9cDandelion Seed\xe2\x80\x9d). But the most striking relationships depicted here are platonic ones among men, stained by toxic interpretations of masculinity handed down from generation to generation. On \xe2\x80\x9cEvening Prayer,\xe2\x80\x9d he wants to tell his sick friend that he cares for him, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re close enough. On the\xc2\xa0crushing Kings of Convenience-esque \xe2\x80\x9cHow Can I Tell Him,\xe2\x80\x9d Lekman\xc2\xa0wonders if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to tell his best friend he loves him. The song is a crash course in what makes Lekman so endearing: the mundane anecdotes and intimate moments that colorfully illustrate why he loves his friend, the elegant arrangement of an infectious melody and timeless croon.' b'The album\xe2\x80\x99s title imagines its characters\xe2\x80\x94the tentative bride, the nostalgic ex-lover, even the young Lekman\xe2\x80\x94as patients in a waiting room, waiting for their lives to start, for the nurse to pop in and say, \xe2\x80\x9cLife will see you now.\xe2\x80\x9d Lekman knows that waiting room well. It\xe2\x80\x99s the place he was trapped when he wrote \xe2\x80\x9cPostcard #17,\xe2\x80\x9d stuck inside his own head, paralyzed by fear and self-doubt\xe2\x80\x94feelings most writers can relate to. But the\xc2\xa0triumph of Life Will See You Now\xc2\xa0is how it suggests\xc2\xa0that the 36-year-old Lekman has never been more skilled at his craft, or had more stories to tell.'"
b'Vermont',6.8,b'II',0,b'Electronic',b'February 22 2017',"b""Danilo Plessow and Marcus Worgull's second full-length ambient project strips away percussion and focuses on the soul and timbre of classic analog synthesizers.""","b""It continues to be a long, dark winter for new ambient music. Warm fuzzies are in short supply; doubt and discontent prevail. Think of Huerco S.\xe2\x80\x99s lo-fi churn, Sarah Davachi\xe2\x80\x99s stark drones, or\xc2\xa0Egyptrixx\xe2\x80\x99s battered futurism. But there are some glorious summers hiding in Suzanne Kraft\xe2\x80\x99s recent *What You Get for Being Young\xc2\xa0*and\xc2\xa0Brian Eno\xe2\x80\x99s latest generative composition Reflection, which often evoked the stillness of an autumn evening. Also retreating from icy climes is the German duo Vermont, who've followed up their self-titled 2014 debut with an ambient album far warmer and more beautiful than its predecessor."" b'Vermont was an unexpected development from Danilo Plessow and Marcus Worgull, the two artists behind the project. Plessow made his name in the late \xe2\x80\x9900s making crisp, finely crafted house and disco as Motor City Drum Ensemble, while\xc2\xa0Worgull has spent the past dozen years refining his minimalist house epics for the Innervisions label. And while Kompakt has made a cottage industry out of ambient thanks to the label\xe2\x80\x99s annual Pop Ambient compilations, *Vermont *sounded different. It grew out of a series of open-ended studio jams using a battery of vintage analog gear, which was both its biggest strength and weakness. The record sounded wonderful\xe2\x80\x94a feast for the ears\xe2\x80\x94but its cycling arpeggios and drifting pads occasionally lacked direction, often feeling less like the work of a single ensemble than a compilation by a number of artists who loved all things Can and kosmische.' b'On II, Plessow and Worgull are back behind iconic workhorses like the Moog Prodigy and Arp Odyssey, synthesizers renowned for their buttery tone. The results feel clearer this time; they\xe2\x80\x99ve honed in on a narrower set of sounds across the length of the album, leading to a much more cohesive listen. Additionally, they\xe2\x80\x99ve opted to go without any drums at all, and most tracks utilize just a three elements: bassline, midrange arpeggio, and contrapuntal leads weaving high overhead. Their spare arrangements and measured tempos allow each electronic voice to come into focus. While artfully layering simple lines and lavishing attention on timbre, panning, and legato, they stir up an enveloping sound that makes the most of its underlying waveforms.' b""Once again, krautrock\xe2\x80\x99s ambient electronic strains remain their primary inspiration; the plucked guitar of \xe2\x80\x9cNorderney\xe2\x80\x9d invokes Manuel G\xc3\xb6ttsching\xe2\x80\x99s Inventions for Electric Guitar; airy tracks like \xe2\x80\x9cDschuna\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGebirge\xe2\x80\x9d draw inspiration from Cluster and Brian Eno. Looking further afield, the burnished, detuned tones of \xe2\x80\x9cChemtrails\xe2\x80\x9d recall Aphex Twin\xe2\x80\x99s Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II. And in \xe2\x80\x9cKi-Bou,\xe2\x80\x9d a riff inspired by Larry Heard\xe2\x80\x99s bright, agile basslines amplifies the music\xe2\x80\x99s field of vision. Mostly, though, these aren't stylistic exercises but carefully distilled mood pieces. In \xe2\x80\x9cHallo von der Anderen Seite,\xe2\x80\x9d a rippling synthesizer melody wraps circles around a plucked mbira, and given the music\xe2\x80\x99s fanciful qualities, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine it as an animated still life, or a conversation between potted plants. \xe2\x80\x9cWenik\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94named after the birch rods that sauna-goers use to stimulate the circulation\xe2\x80\x94suggests two colored liquids mixing together in slow motion."" b'Though the average track length hovers around the four-minute mark, many of these sequences could, like most ambient music, go on indefinitely. But Vermont have figured out how to make these comparatively short, sketch-like pieces work for them. They stretch out just long enough to draw you in and wrap you up in their atmospheres, but they never wear out their welcome. Like most *kosmische *musicians, Vermont dream big\xe2\x80\x94but never at the expense of the small, tactile details at their fingertips.'"
