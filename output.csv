Common,8.4,Electric Circus,1,Rap,An hour ago,"Common’s 2002 album is a massive group effort: Prince, Erykah Badu, Pharrell, Jill Scott, and many more built a sound that helped change the limits of rap, soul, and R&B."
Standing on the Corner,8.0,Red Burns,0,Experimental,An hour ago,"Standing on the Corner is the collaboration of two jazz-inclined oddballs from New York City. Their dazzling, invigorating Red Burns project is a freeform response to recent world events."
Cécile McLorin Salvant,7.6,Dreams and Daggers,0,Jazz,An hour ago,"The young jazz singer’s live double album showcases the gravitas, humor, and modernity she brings both to classic standards and her own compositions."
Ziúr,7.1,U Feel Anything?,0,Electronic,An hour ago,"In her abraded experimental club music, Berlin producer Ziúr favors a skeletal sound that still confidently occupies a maximal amount of space. It suggests that agitation can produce beauty."
Kelela,8.6,Take Me Apart,1,Pop/R&B,October 6 2017,"Kelela’s debut album is technically stunning and emotionally realized. It lives in a new, outré, rhythmic pop galaxy that honors but outpaces its peers."
Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith,8.1,The Kid,0,Experimental,October 6 2017,"On her most accessible album yet, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith draws out the organic qualities of her Buchla modular synth. But The Kid sparks a bodily pleasure alongside her music’s cerebral delights."
Deradoorian,7.4,Eternal Recurrence,0,Experimental,October 6 2017,"Angel Deradoorian zooms in on the heady, spiritual undercurrent of her past work for the new age Eternal Recurrence, which is hushed, meditative, and bathed in amber glow."
Various Artists,7.5,Josie and the Pussycats—Music from the Motion Picture,0,,October 6 2017,The first reissue of the 2001 film’s soundtrack solidifies the lasting musical legacy of three Archie comics characters.
Liam Gallagher,4.9,As You Were,0,Rock,October 5 2017,"The debut solo album from the 45-year-old, would-be rock’n’roll savior fails to match the charm of his cantankerous public persona."
A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie,7.0,The Bigger Artist,0,Rap,October 5 2017,The New York rapper’s promising debut showcases a 21-year-old who’s still finding his own lane between sensitivity and swagger.
Jhené Aiko,6.7,Trip,0,Pop/R&B,October 5 2017,"Written during a period of grief, Jhené Aiko’s 22-track LP turns her methods of survival—enlightenment, drugs, music itself—into an epic concept album. Some of Aiko’s most honest writing occurs here."
Omni,7.2,Multi-task,0,Rock,October 5 2017,"The wiry Atlanta, Ga. rock trio Omni sells its nervous energy as a logical way of dealing with the world. Where other bands might smooth things out, Omni finds angles and sharp turns."
